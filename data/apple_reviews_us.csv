2020-10-28 03:15:26,blooolp,False,Cool but empty,"I assume its just cause its new, it has great ideas for cards I just wish you could get more than 3 slots and also wish you could customize them more. The defaults are pretty cringe. Like, the “area 51 raid” card is a good idea for showing off your favorite stuff, just the unfortunate thing is that it’s all full of dead memes and even the raid itself is super dead. You’d be better off not sticking to putting current memes into it cause millennials and gen z don’t really take to it as much and it’s because they’re slow to implement. Just let the users insert whatever they want there and let them shake it up a little. That would be way better

Also, I haven’t gotten any matches yet despite I guess being a girl which this app also seems to lack some of. But I won’t fault it to the app it’s still clearly gaining user base you guys will get more users if you give more options, or maybe even implement mini games that you can play when you match to someone",4,
2021-02-25 03:54:12,Antmo01,False,Some of my thoughts,"First off, I just wanna say that this is app is creative with the card system and the whole choose 9 favorite games to display. I actually enjoyed filling all of those out and I looked forward to seeing other people posting their favorite stuff. However, from what I noticed on the reviews on this app (and with personal experience) is that I and some other people haven’t found 1 match, despite having it for some time. I had this app for over 2 weeks now, I still couldn’t find a match. I’m not sure if it’s just a me thing, but it doesn’t feel like it because I tried my best to look attractive to some people and I’ve seen other reviews out there having the same issue. I don’t think my account is even visible on the app because of this. I also dislike the 30 swipes a day deal, even if I’m not attracted to the person and swipe left, it counts as one. Extremely restricting for the user. I understand it’s a small base and it’s at it’s early stages, but c’mon not one match? Even after a couple of weeks? I just feel like this app isn’t good enough to even interact with people, at least not yet, since it doesn’t match you with others. Ironic, since it’s a dating app. This app has potential though.",2,
2020-11-05 07:41:17,jj_2077,False,"Cool concept, but poor execution and empty app","Conceptually, this is a very interesting way to approach dating apps. I like the customizable cards and the ability to link up to nine of your favorite games to your profile. The low number of photos you can submit of yourself (up to four) may be a turn off for some, but I personally prefer it. HOWEVER, this app is held back by two major factors: a low number of accounts and the very limited amount of swipes per day. I have only logged into the app a few times and have already gone through every profile within a reasonable radius. You can expand this radius to +500 miles, but unless you are up for a long distance relationship, most people are going to be looking within 50 miles and even that’s pushing it. The fact I went through every profile is even more surprising when you realize you are limited to 30 swipes a day. Not likes, swipes. As in you are allowed to look at up to 30 profiles a day before you are tapped out. I only recently managed to get one match and as of right now she has not responded. There is potential here, but as of right now it’s mediocre at best.",3,
2020-10-05 19:11:24,SoundsLikeALottaHOOPLAH,False,"A good app, but not very useful","While the idea of the app is excellent in concept (I had fun just filling out my profile and viewing other people’s for a few weeks), I’ve never had a single match. Just about every single day for at least a month, I’ve exhausted my available likes and sent my one free message to a girl I thought was cute and I’ve gotten nothing back. Not even a like by *anyone*. I’m not a male model, granted, but I put effort into my profile and my messages. To not even get a single like implies to me that this app has an intense gender imbalance and the girls that do try it out are swamped with likes and messages. Distance doesn’t really matter, either: for the first few weeks I was content to set it at the maximum distance, but got nothing. When I lowered to my immediate area and swiped through my potential matches, I also got nothing. 

I feel like if I even had a single like or match to show me that I *exist* on this app, I’d be more inclined to use it. As it stands now, though, I consistently forget that I even own it because nothing ever comes of it.",3,
2020-06-29 15:05:11,Xandaroth,False,Finally a legit app for gamers!?,"After being burned out on all the dating apps with shady practices owned by Matchgroup, this app is seriously refreshing. You can connect with people based on gaming lifestyles and the Card system is a fantastic way to express yourself even if you’re not a big fan of filling out profiles. 

The algorithm is extremely honest and transparent, plus it doesn’t try to decide what you want for you. It will tell you if there are people in your area and it won’t get funky with showing you matches outside of what you search for. 

I’m just an average guy who likes to strike up normal, casual conversation as an opener and there’s this membrane I often can’t punch through on usual “industry” dating apps. On Kippo, I’m actually getting conversations from matches and that’s after only having signed up for a few days!

Not to mention, their premium service was only $10/month, or less if I were to get the multi-month subscription?? Goodbye OkCupid and your ridiculous $50/Month A-List. You can play an MMO for $15/month, so Kippo’s pricing actually respects my time and my money. 

Keep up the great work!! I’m going to stay subscribed to premium and see how Kippo expands and evolves over time. I definitely want more card variety, and it would be great if I could list more games as favorites or as a “here’s what I’ll play with you” list. Other than that, expanding the user base is the only urgent thing I’d like to see.",5,
2020-03-12 09:00:55,Xenuh,False,Cool App!,"This app is so unique, i’ve never seen anything like it! I love how it’s mainly based around gaming and personality, unlike the majority of dating apps these days. If there’s one thing I could change, it would be a bigger variety of preference options and a longer “swiping” amount. i personally think it’s unfair that i have to waste my swipes on people who i’m uninterested in. for example, i’m an xbox player and i want to connect with only xbox and psn players but there’s no options for that so i get matched with a pc player. swiping left technically counts as a swipe. i’ve gone 2 days swiping left and have ran out of swipes. if you’re going to limit the amount, i think it should be based on the amount of matches you get and not the amount of people you go through. overall i love this app and i would recommend it to EVERY gamer looking for friends/love!",4,"{'id': 14873083, 'body': 'Hello!\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to leave us a review!

2020-08-31 13:22:07,Joey Tagliatelle,False,Fake reviews + Horrible app,"First off, please go take a look at all the 5 star reviews. They all have similar generic titles and comment how “wonderful” of an dating app this is (and are also all ironically mass posted on the same block of days). Here’s why I believe these reviews are fake: 

The concept of the app is interesting, but the execution is lackluster at best. You are limited to 30 swipes per day, which includes likes and dislikes. That is asinine - no other dating app is this restrictive. Furthermore, actually matching with people is seemly impossible. I have been on this app for over 1 month now and have not received a single match. Each day I swiped on 30 people meaning after sifting through 1000 people I couldn’t find a single match. I even started swiping on people that I was not even remotely attracted to and still nothing. There is not a single dating app out there that I have had this experience with.

Please do not waste your time with this app. If you are eager to find someone to date that plays video games, your are exponentially more likely to meet them in whatever game you like than this joke of a platform.",1,
2020-06-24 08:41:01,Hikarigami,False,"Good, could still use work","So while I really like the niche aspect of this app, it’s frustrating that I’ve encountered the same people over and over again. It’s one thing if someone passed on me in the past and I show up again to them to give them another chance, but if I like someone once, they shouldn’t show up in my queue again.

This wouldn’t be quite so bad, if not for the fact that you’re limited on how many profiles you can view a day, meaning you often get clogged down with repeat profiles.

I get it if I live in an area with not that many users, but I’m in the SF bay, which is THE nerd hot spot of America. I should be fine. I’d rather have no one available than see the same people over and over again. L",4,
2021-02-15 19:19:03,Kfkfkdjfjf,False,Nice design but not full of people,"Let me just say that I love how this app looks, I also thinks it’s pretty simple to use. 
I think the idea of the cards is super creative, but I wish there were more kinds of cards and that you could add more than 3 to your profile. 
I also feel like this app is kinda empty? I mean I’ve used this for 3 days and I’m lucky enough to get the 30 profiles it promises you and they all seem different so I don’t see repeating ones. The limit kinda makes it feel empty tho? 
I don’t know how many females there are on this app though. I’m a female myself and maybe there’s more males so that’s why I have the luxury of seeing more profiles? 
I will say that I haven’t seen tons of makes that are attractive to me though. It’s not the apps fault at all, just something to think about if you’re a female wanting to try this app. 
I could see this more of a social platform to meet other gamers instead of a dating website. The aesthetic doesn’t really fit a dating app, but it does fit an app that will help connect you to more gamers. Think like geek to geek except this app doesn’t feel like it’s trying to scam you out of money. 
In short, it looks cool, easy to use, just not a lot of people? Would love if you could find friends on this app in addition to it being a dating app.",3,
2019-11-15 03:59:48,St3pharu,True,Great App,"[EDIT at bottom]
I love the style and design of this app for sure. Definitely more unique than what I’ve seen before in similar apps, but I only have one issue with it. It seems that the aspect ratio is off on my iPhone 7s, and it cuts off a little bit of information sometimes. For instance, when doing the personality card, I can’t choose the very bottom option of assertive or turbulent because it is cut off on the bottom. There are a few instances of that happening in the application, but I’m sure it’s just a small fix for the devs. Love what y’all are doing keep it up!

2020-07-07 00:44:11,juhookerun,False,Wish there was more search options,"I happily paid for the membership fee as I cannot stand all the other dating apps out there and want to support people making better options (especially for gamers). 

My main gripe is that the search radius is either 0-99 or the whole planet. It would be rad if there were more variables (200, 500 miles etc) and also maybe a game search. For example if I wanted to find a gal who also plays FFXIV. 

Anyways, really good job so far! Please please do not go to some algorithm based junk like other apps. It’s so much harder to meet people than it was before when algorithms didn’t rule the dating site world.",4,
2020-11-12 23:35:33,Scooobysnacks,False,Well designed and easy to use - but empty,"This is actually a charming app. It’s obviously in its beginning stages though with such a tiny user base. It’s so new you can get a ‘founder’s badge’ for being the first to sign up for the paid service which is fairly priced imo compared to other competing apps. 

Downside: if you don’t pay it’s only 30 swipes a day which is reality is a decent amount but realistically takes a few minutes of swiping then that’s it. It counts swiping left or right as one of the 30 uses per day - just food for thought. 

Okay - so is the ROI there yet to use it. Depends on your outlook of things. I’d say build a profile and swipe occasionally. The app is growing for sure but TINY right now. If you’re in a big city you’ll still run out of people to swipe on incredibly quick. However, if this apps takes off it will be a fantastic user experience for all parties involved. 

So check it out - but don’t expect anything (literally) for awhile. I’m giving it 3 stars for it being empty - which isn’t inherently the app’s fault - but it does effect the user’s experience seeing absolutely no traction on their profile.",3,
2020-12-14 17:00:37,iMikeyPro,False,"Really well made app, lots of promise!","Keep it up devs, this app is well made, has cool features, is secure with an option to flag bots, and has a focus on gamers. it’s honestly better than 99% of dating apps out there. Just needs 1) more people, and 2) a way to connect with gamers that play the same games. If we could meet people that play the same online games easily, it doesn’t matter as much that there aren’t so many people in our immediate geographic area. I think a lot of gamers would be fine with meeting people and connecting further over games, especially with the whole COVID thing going on. Make this happen!",5,
2021-02-23 08:40:26,eumajo,False,Good app :),Hi! So I’ve had this app for about two weeks now. I think the app is great so far. I haven’t had any bug issues so far like some people have. I as a female trying to match with males have had a lot of matches. I found a lot of people I like I really recommend this app. Not everyone on the app is “bad looking” and what I mean by that is that there’s someone for everyone. There is a mix of people both skinny and plus size so there’s someone for everyone. I got a relationship out of this one :) only bad thing I would add is that the profiles sometimes do reappear more that once. Hope this review helps!,5,
2020-06-18 03:41:33,Is this a pigeon,False,Can’t do a lot,"I don’t know if it’s because of screen scaling issues or what, but I can’t fill out/complete a lot of things. Because my keyboard remains up while trying to fill in favorite games, I can’t see the last few options when searching (I could puuuuull the list up just enough to *see* the game I wanted, but couldn’t select it)
Same problem with some of the cards. I couldn’t adjust the last slider on the personality type card, and I couldn’t complete the Harry Potter card because I couldn’t select anything for the Patronus (I assume that’s what’s down there in the place-that-cannot-be-seen)

It is a fun concept but I can’t even properly build my profile 🤷‍♀️",3,"{'id': 16261816, 'body': 'Hello,\n\nThanks for your feedback. Kippo is compatible for iphone6 and newer phones.

2021-01-01 23:38:17,This is a horrible game!!!,False,Odd choices,"This app is actually pretty cool at first. Its focused on gaming and stuff and you can mark your favorite games so you have something easy to start convos with. The app isnt super relationship focused which is nice so you can talk casually. There needs to be alot more tabs to let you place games you play though, let us put a bunch and make it a “see more” option after the first 9 that you have now.

But the worst decision is you can only swipe 30 people each DAY. So you hop on for like 2 minutes and then bye. What an odd choice. I get all these apps always have a bunch of things like this but cmon, the most basic key feature is what youre going to limit? Makes the app almost not worth using since you barely can see anyone that uses it.",2,

2020-08-28 14:25:04,silvasilvers,False,The EA of Dating Apps,"First of all if you're a brand new dating app I would suggest that you wouldn't immediately start being money-hungry and make the entire purpose of your app to be paid for. Second, you only get 30 swipes every 24 hours when you’re using it for free and that's ridiculous. No one wants to wait that long and no one wants to pay to find someone to play videogames/love, whatever.

You rarely get a match and that's because your app isn't popular and the reason why it's not is because you pull your users in and then decide to charge us for a subscription that's not worth it. I would suggest get your marketing staff together and reconfigure your priorities.

As a gamer this is basically the EA of dating apps because you sure are making this app unplayable if I don't buy the DLC. 

I'm Alt+Control+Deleting myself out of this app.

Haha get it? But seriously I won't come back until you give people more swipes. I could find more gamers on Tinder or Bumble than your sorry excuse of a sub par dating app.",1,
2020-07-19 03:50:50,Justus Foehrkolb,False,"Cool idea, poorly implemented","Honestly the idea is AMAZING. First app I’ve ever downloaded from and ad in my life. But there’s some strange limitations. You can only have 4 pictures and no more. The biggest issue is that you only get 15 to 20 swipes PER DAY. And yes, swipes. Not matches, not swipe rights. If you don’t like anyone that day and swipe left all 20 or so times you’re done. I’m assuming it’s to keep people coming back since the app is new and they don’t want you to blow through everyone in your area in one day (due to being new) but yikes.

My suggestions would be first and foremost GREATLY extend the limit of swipes.
Another idea would be to have a visible checklist of what consoles/systems you have. Include PC, consoles, VR, everything. Also maybe have a specific image slot for your gaming set up to show off your space.

If things change for the better I will update my review but as it stands, being done swiping for the entire day in about 3 minutes is very discouraging.",2,
2020-01-02 08:56:43,PhoSwag,False,Good but...,"The 50 swipes a day is really detrimental to the app’s growth. After you swipe 50 cards and you don’t have any matches there is literally nothing to do on the app.

My suggestion: As much as I HATE ads (I really really despise them) I feel like it would be a good idea to maybe watch an ad after your 50 swipes to get an additional “x” amount of swipes. That way there is some sort of incentive for the user to stay on the app.

I also really hate writing reviews but this app is exactly what I’ve been looking for and would love to see it thrive.",3,

It’s a lovely concept. The 30 swipe thing is kinda dumb in my opinion especially since the number still goes down if you aren’t interested in the profile you’re viewing.

2019-08-18 19:13:24,Chilblane,False,Fills an overlooked gap in the dating app space,"Kippo is a really interesting app with a lot of promise and potential. 

1. It’s extremely well-polished and you can tell a lot of thought and care has gone into it so far. The creators understand the types of people that would use this app and how existing apps fail them. The onboarding experience is great and there’s a lot of clever ideas that appeal to gamers like the gaming profile cards. I also hugely appreciate tapping instead of swiping since it’s way too easy to accidentally swipe the wrong direction in other apps. 

2. Kippo caters to both “dating” and “social” but it would be good in the future to maybe separate those into two distinct modes so there’s less ambiguity. I can see this app doing really well just as a tool to fill up your various gaming friends lists with people you already know are cool and interesting. 

3.  The favorite games section is probably one of the most important parts of the profile, so I think it should be a) required to list at least one game and b) make it clearer whether they are just your favorite games or the games you are looking to play with someone else on Kippo. 

4. As a brand-new app there’s obviously not a lot of people yet on the app so you might be discouraged by the number of results if you don’t set your slider to max distance (100+). Don’t be discouraged! For a lot of gamers, in a world of duo queues and discord voice chats, distance means nothing. I recommend trying the app and spreading the word because this app WILL grow.",5,
2019-09-06 08:34:19,yoojpls,False,It’s Rare to See a Focus on Connections,"I’ve dipped my feet into the pool of dating apps before, but have never felt particularly attached to either their interfaces or the people that saturate their user market. I find it very difficult to find people to match with on apps like Tinder, especially since user profiles are left entirely up to the individual to write up for self-promotion, and oftentimes these fall (a lot) short of dazzling. 

That’s why I really like Kippo. It’s my first time seeing options to fill out fun little quizzes and personality cards to show, rather than blandly tell your interests. There’s a free space card for you to detail a self-introduction written in your own words, of course, but I feel like this feature really takes a burden off the average user’s shoulders in trying to come up with something mildly interesting that others might want to follow up on. I also am a big fan of the neon retro design, which imo, is a super cool aesthetic in line with the gamer theme. 

But most important/unique of all the features Kippo has to offer is the set timeline for conversations. If you match with someone, you have 24 hours to strike up a conversation with them before they disappear into oblivion. And if one of the matched has plucked up enough courage to initiate the talking, then the two have seven days to converse about anything. And when that time’s up, the conversation is finally sent to the shadow realm for good. At first, I was a little disgruntled by the disappearing act, but I understand now that it’s implemented in order to really motivate people to move outside the app and connect more through a common love of games, movies/tv shows, and other pop culture. It’s a stepping stone, but not the final destination to what is hopefully a super great friendship or 👀👀 romance!! 

I’m really impressed with Kippo, which shows since it’s the only “dating” app that’s still kept on my phone LOL.",5,

2019-09-18 01:58:33,Garrujak,False,"Great Concept, Faulty Execution","I initially signed up for Kippo back before it was fully developed, as a place for gamers to meet seemed right up my alley, as nerdy types tend not to do well on the traditional dating apps. While I’ve used Kippo every day since release, I sadly can confirm that it failed to do anything meaningful in all this time.

My main gripe is the location bug: it will tell you EVERYONE on the app is within your distance range. I sadly found myself engaging with a wonderful woman, only to discover she lives across the country, and as two people not interested in long distance, we had no further reason to talk. 

On top of that, the limited talk time is quite an odd feature, and one I can’t actually grasp. Aren’t gamers traditionally the less social types? I myself don’t want to exchange phone numbers with everyone I talk to for 10 days, and it seems like it’s either “commit or this person disappears” which is NOT the way for someone to feel safe and comfortable in a dating environment.

Lastly, my third gripe is the celebrity profiles, just why? I know swiping on AngelsKimi isn’t going to net me a conversation with her, so why is she in my feed? Hell, xChocobars is IN A RELATIONSHIP, seems like she shouldn’t even be on the app, so likely that profile is fake. Why use them? It either excites people not able to reason why they’re not real, or just proves to be a wasted swipe, as you have a limit to profile views in a day.

All in all, I cannot recommend Kippo at the current time. I hope the devs create something magical in the future, but as of now, I’ve uninstalled.",2,"{'id': 10829128, 'body': 'Hello.
