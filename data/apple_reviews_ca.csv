"The app works alright, and has acceptable functionality. They put you on worldwide search by default, since you‚Äôll probably only see 10-20 profiles a day your first week, then one or two a day if you search locally.",3,POTATOeTREE,2020-06-24 15:46:16,"Ok, but no people.",False

"i suggest that if ppl are using the app just to make friends to play with then they should be given the option to turn their location off. i‚Äôm not tryna let everyone know where i live, especially since there r probably groomers on the app. please look over my suggestion and make it happen! app would be much better ü§ù",1,Raynabeans,2021-03-12 07:07:21,it‚Äôs meh,False

"trigger warning for mentions of suicide and abuse// 

back in may i was recovering from a serious breakup from an emotionally abusive relationship and losing my job of 2 1/2 years and started a new one. i was 8 months out of highschool, didn‚Äôt get accepted to college, and had basically no friends except for 2 who had their own things going on, so i rarely talked to them about my own problems after enough months of making them deal with my breakup and job loss+regain. i felt so alone by this point i was locked up in my room doing nothing but painting or playing animal crossing every day, smoking weed, and contemplating suicide. i came so close too. then one day i got curious cause i‚Äôd never actually tried a dating app before, but i found this one in the app store while searching for ones to download. to be totally honest i was looking for sugar dating apps to make money instead, but then i noticed kippo and it said for gamers. i was hesitant because my ex was a gamer, and like i said, he was really emotionally abusive. he was also a raging alcoholic so that was a major no no. but upon downloading kippo, i saw how different it was from all the other apps, and that it showed things i actually cared about with people. the first week was completely dead, i wasn‚Äôt getting anyone worth swiping on, but i wasn‚Äôt expecting to so i just kept going. then one night things got really bad for me, and i began making suicide notes and videos for my friends and family. i had only made one 45 minute video and note for one of my friends before i was interrupted by a message from the app. it was the second time anyone actually sent me a chat, and he was more interesting than the first guy. to be honest i wasn‚Äôt a fan of the chat system so i asked him to add me on snapchat, and then we kept talking from there before i quickly gave him my phone number. the next night i got home from the new job i was working and asked him to play animal crossing together, and he said yes. it was an instant connection once we started speaking in the discord call as i visited his island, and that same night i asked to fall asleep to him on call, cause i was needy, and he said yes. not a day has gone by since then that we haven‚Äôt facetimed or texted or called in discord, and i wouldn‚Äôt trade it for anything. when i finally got the strength to leave my ex, i swore the only time i‚Äôd ever fall in love with a man again was if he was the complete opposite, and loved me the way i deserved so i could love him back just as much and not feel taken advantage of for it, and my noah is exactly that. i have kippo to thank for introducing me to a literal angel. thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",5,lexfox,2020-10-20 22:28:54,met my boyfriend on here :) üíû,False
Considering the low user base already... it‚Äôs hard to find matches and then they delete all the matches while forcing an update,2,fakeProtoZero,2020-08-03 01:30:03,App update resets matches,False
The new updates somehow deleted all my messages and won‚Äôt allow me to match with anyone anymore,2,Sabrina8Star,2020-08-03 00:27:52,Was good now sucks,False
"It‚Äôs an alright app, definitely can say most chicks on here are just trying to gain followers instead of getting to know you.

New update made me lose all the matches and conversations I had, thanks guys!",1,_koro_,2020-08-02 12:23:43,It‚Äôs kinda it good,False

"When it asks you for pictures or yourself, it‚Äôs taking way too long as if the app is going more than what it‚Äôs supposed to with your photos",1,Ashley2525,2020-03-30 10:36:27,What a waste,False

"Since I don‚Äôt leave my house, I can at least know that the person I meet on here doesn‚Äôt leave their house either. So we can just be 2 virgins playing games until 5am everyday. Since I play people in real life already I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not hard to do it on here either. It Would be nice if it would only show you people that play at least 1 of your 9 games you play. And they should really add an option for if you play on PC or Console For obvious reasons. Socially speaking it‚Äôs good because everyone on here has the social skills of a rat so conversations can go just about anywhere. Thanks for reading my review and hope u can enjoy the app as much as myself.",5,Tmanvos,2020-04-26 12:08:11,"I‚Äôm anitisocial, better than tinder",False
"The main problem with this app is how few people you‚Äôre allowed to see. Without paying for the premium service, you see about 25 profiles per day whether you like them or not, and then you‚Äôre locked out of seeing any more new people for 24 hours. 
If you were to go to Tinder or Bumble or PoF or any other dating app you get at least 50 likes per day and you can view as many people as you‚Äôd like.",1,MattsAppReviews,2020-02-25 13:47:25,Previous review deleted for some reason.,False
It asks for a phone verification at the beginning and I put my phone number and it doesn‚Äôt send anything.,1,TheSadCustomer999999990,2020-01-22 23:07:47,"Doesn‚Äôt work, don‚Äôt download!",False
"So far this seems like a great concept, implemented pretty well, biggest complaint is that the ‚Äúcards‚Äù can‚Äôt be filled all the way out because some fields get covered by the ‚Äúdone‚Äù button (maybe this is unique to older/smaller devices, I‚Äôm on an iPhone SE), adding a scroll feature or something so smaller devices can actually complete the cards would be great!

I‚Äôm also not sure there‚Äôs an option for a proper bio? But perhaps one of the cards offers that

Otherwise keep it up!",4,Dog-man77,2019-12-29 19:17:23,"Decent, but not without issues",False

"Not a lot of ‚Äúdating‚Äù apps accept gaming. A lot put a tug a on it if anything. This app is early in its public lifecycle, but it‚Äôs got a lot of promise and I‚Äôm interested to see where it goes.",5,Feisal Merali,2019-08-16 19:49:36,Early but interesting,False
