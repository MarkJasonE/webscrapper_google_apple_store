Before Kippo, your only options were generic dating apps that obviously had no correlation with people relating to the gaming realm. You're no longer a minority here, and that's why this app is worth the merited try. You might be worried about the 3.5 stars, and like every other app, there's bugs here and there. The team has been taking care of those in the couple months I've been using the app. The notable smaller user base argument is accurate, but this app has only been live for over a year. The free tier only allows 30 swipes a day (regardless of right and left), which you could argue is low if you're an active dater, but a pretty standard number for the average Joe. A huge highlight in the swipe process is the ability to send a message instead of swiping. A majority of my matches were from sending initial messages. Utilize that feature as much as you can. Kippo profile customization is quite unique. You've got your normal picture section, a section where you can add your favorite games, and various panels to express yourself. Overall, a featureful and visually beautiful app. I've had Infinity (paid tier) for about three months now, and I've found incredible people both in my area and across NA.",5,0,1.0.23,2020-12-07 13:21:57,,

Still eh about the one message a day, but once you match the between messages are unlimited",4,16,1.0.1,2020-09-23 05:01:43,Thanks so much for taking the time to leave us a review. TBH we thought we were giving a lot more than the other apps out there. You can send unlimited messages for free but DMs are limited to 1/day. Think of it like a superlike. We don't charge for things like undos and unlimited search range. This is great feedback though and we'll consider it.,2020-09-23 04:58:58

I'll start with what I like: Dark mode is excellent; the gamer-centric cards are fun, interactive, and unique; the overall design is very clean; small details (chat color tweaks and flairs) are nice additions. It's missing many key dating app features: filters for looking for (and others); any kind of bio/leading answers from which to spark meaningful conversation; game titles to select; and viewing who's liked you.",3,4,1.0.1,2020-09-23 04:53:39,"Hey!

I think it truly was built for gamers. They have neat little cards to help show your favourite games. The matching is really good too.

Now if you want to extend past 30 likes a day to infinity you pay a monthly fee.
