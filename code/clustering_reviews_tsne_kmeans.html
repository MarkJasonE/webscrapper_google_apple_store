Thanks so much for your feedback. We've used every dating app out there and they all require bios. What you end up with is a bunch of profiles with empty bios or instagram handles.

We're still a new app but we are definitely building the things that you mentioned. We are working 24/7 to make Kippo better for everyone and we're so excited to share the new stuff that we've been working on.","Hey! Thank you for trying Kippo. We don't show inactive accounts so you will not be wasting any swipes. I would recommend sending DMs to people you are interested in. DMs have a much higher match rate than just liking.","NaN","Haha! I'll take you up on that challenge. Thanks so much for trying Kippo! So glad you're enjoying it!","NaN","Hey Hayden. We wanted to give sort of a daily batch of profiles so that people don't burn out.

We fixed this issue and you are now able to better control who get's to view your profile and message you.","NaN","NaN","oops XD","Hey! So I'm a little confused here because we purposefully priced Kippo to be lower than all the other major dating apps. Kippo is free to use and only $10 a month for Kippo Infinity. The phone number login is the safest login and a standard across most apps including pretty much every dating app.","We use phone login because it is more secure that email.

If you would like, I can take a look at your account to see if everything is normal. Email me sup@kippoapp.com. We have sophisticated AI that removes bots and we rarely have any bots on Kippo if any.","Hey Chase thanks so much for your review! Tinder gives you 0 superlikes for free so though we were being nice with 1 DM per day but we've been discussing increasing this number. We recently upgraded our algorithm to better server the LGBT community so the experience should be much better.

We are so glad that you are taking a chance and putting yourself out there! Please let us know if there is anything we can help you with to make Kippo a 5 star experience for you.

We will do whatever we can to make this a great experience for you! Best, Kippo Team","Hey Joel. Have you checked out the \"text prompt\" card? You can choose from a set of prompts or write a freeform bio.","Hey Chris! Thanks so much for the feedback. Kippo is still pretty new but we are growing quickly.

love the design of this app. It is visually appealing and easy to use. However, I can't figure out how to see the profiles I've liked or message people. Is there no way to do that as a free user? If there is, I can't find that option anywhere. I would greatly appreciate it if the developer would please clarify that. Other than that, the app is great so far, other than extremely barebones, especially in terms of settings.","I sent one message and was informed that I had to wait till tomorrow to send another waited 24 hours and still couldn't send messages. This app is just a money grab and not worth it. Messaging should be free since you're already charging for everything else.","\"Does this app make you happy?\"","Ok, the concept of this app is awesome, but is it even real ? I have had it for over 3 months now and havent gotten a single match, and now im starting to wonder if i should just go kill myself.","Can't even try the app. Requires to validate with a code that they send through text and I never got it.","Said 10 people liked me (\ud83d\ude00), I checked to see and not a single profile showed up (\ud83e\udd72)","It's great for finding people who share in similar interests as me but functionally, the app needs a lot of work. It's not as polished as other well known dating apps like tinder or bumble. For example, the app freezes often, won't refresh text messages (I have to exit the app and reopen it to get it to refresh most of the time), anyone can message you even if they are outside of your preference restrictions. Most of the time when using this app, I get frustrated with it's glitchyness.","Has Potential but, I want to request a feature that hides inactive profiles. I feel like most of the profiles on the app that I get are not active an it be nice to just have a free feature that if the user has been inactive for like 7 days. It'll disable their profile temporarily so active users that are free or paid don't come across thier inactive profile. The only way to get the profile back to active status for that inactive user is just simply logging back in. Please add that in.","Pov yore going to get cat fish","So my only issue is that it tells me to add my phone number and i dont have one so its best i wanna use my google account instead. Can u guys fix that plz?","I'm still having a buggy experience where I can't upload all 4 photos and thus cannot create an account","I need to address this while I'm still in the early stage of using this app. I must acknowledge the style and customization of profiles is fairly appealing, however the downside is the limited choices between 3 out of like 6 different templates to help you stand out. It's cool, but as a \"free\" user you only have 3. Also, it feels like no one is online and your sent messages/likes/views give no indication. Last, there's a viewing limit...per day...on a dating app...what? 3/5 is kinda generous imo","I\u2019ve been using it for a while but there is minimum interaction on here.","Decided to use this as it mentioned it could be used for friends in the ad, but not ideal for friend finding. I have my settings set to find other women only, but it shows me mostly men, and only bisexual or lesbian women. So it's not giving me the chance to see all women as potential friends. This is concerning as I'm not sure what would happen if I was a woman only interested in romance with other women and not men, would it still keep showing me them? The app had a lot of potential tho!","It seems like a really cool app. But I can load it at all after I finished my account.","Idk how the app is yet because I keep putting my phone number in and it doesn't give me my code. so can y'all pls fix it for me?","Great idea, but it won't let me past the screen where I allow it to access my location.","Honestly I would like to give this app a try but it wouldn't let me even create a account on my phone can there please be other ways to create a account like seriously I have spend about half an hour to see if I can make one but I couldn't make one. Honestly if the devs are seeing this please take this into consideration please.","Ive never got onthis app' but I think its the dummest thing is that you have to be over 18 to be on this app, ok I understand if you don't want kid hooking up with adult I underatand. but what happends if a kid purhaps a 12 year boy is trying to find someone his age that he can date that shares the same passion for games and maybe girls at school or where they live are tiredimg them and the just want someone to play with so they can feel like they are feeling cared about you know.","It sucks cuz banded me","This app has a lot of potential for the audience that it's trying to reach. My experience was just ok, like most dating apps there are fake profiles and scammers. I wish there was a verification process so maybe that could weed out the fake ones. Most people are promoting their twitch channels and only fans, which I don't hate, I respect the hustle. Like I said has a lot of potential, but just been disappointing. But it scores points for ease of use, set up and experience within the app.","Really cool app, but I live in NYC and the app keeps telling me it cant find anybody in my area, basiclly making this obsolete. Sometimes it works. 90% of the time it doesn't.","I like the app but am not sure if it is real people or paid employees or bots. Still I will give it a shot.","Takes forever to load into, and no one is in my area but that's just because it's not popular yet. Overall the app is really good User interface wise, and I like how the anime community is present a lot on this app in complimentary to having the video game community. Good app just needs people.","This is the best dating app ever ive already reccomended it to like 8 peeps the best part is that ypu can immedietly see on profiles favorite games so you can find your gamer gf/bf super easy and already have a game to spend quality time on together and if love isnt your thing you can use it to find friends to game with you! another great thing is UNLIKE ANY OTHER dating app this one has nothing you can spend money on!","Well probably going to unstall this app tomorrow haven't got liked back or message it has been weeks already so","Honestly nearly convinced that the app doesn't even work. I don't feel like the direct messaging feature works. And even if it did work right, there are far too few filters to be able to find people with.","This app is a ghost town.","There's no option to look for people who are local","This is the only dating I app I know that does this, but your conversations with your matches have a time limit of 30 days. My match and I who had been talking every couple days (with long paragraph type messages) can no longer message each other, with no way of contacting each other again. People are busy Kippo, I can't keep track of how much time I have left to respond before being booted forever.","Edit: RIP the guys who keep messaging me. I get the notification, but the app always gets stuck on the loading screen.","Not many users on the app and kinda wish there was a way to know if someone else liked your profile.","Tell me my phone number is invalid wdf","This has been a cool app with developments for meeting fellow gaming gamers . I hope to meet more and this app keeps on improving !","Definitely not enough users to make the platform viable within a 50mile radius. However the premise of the app and functionality are all correct. Advertise more.","Do not limit our likes based on if we pass on someone that\u2019s flat out stupid, I shouldn\u2019t go a day without liking a single profile because you limit 30 profiles a day whether you like the person or not","Unfortunately I don't get sent a code when I put in my number so I can't use this app.","Gave this app a try for about a month or two. Never got a match. Seems like a lot of people stopped using the app. I even purchased a monthly sub to give it more of a chance but it would constantly show me the same profiles or it would tell me there\u2019s no profiles to view. It\u2019s a lovely concept. The 30 swipe thing is kinda dumb in my opinion especially since the number still goes down if you aren\u2019t interested in the profile you\u2019re viewing. Maybe in the future there will be more users but it\u2019s a pretty dead app.","The concept of Kippo is very good but the app is missing a lot of things. You cant see previous likes and the population is low. Also you only get 3 cards but you definitely need the text card so you technically only get 2 cards. Theres also not enough cards to make profiles feel unique. Kippo has potential but its not fully there yet.","Was really excited to get this app, right up my alley, but after a few days it\u2019s quiet and disappointing. The profiles are cool and fun, UI is cool a little confusing/ non intuitive. Biggest thing is no one is responsive. Idk if these are bot profiles or maybe I\u2019m just not attractive to nerds lol, but there appears to be no active users except for me? Also a lot of profiles say just looking friends and taken, then get off of the dating app.","I just downloaded the app after seeing a tiktok about it and this app is even cuter than I could have imagined. The UI is pleasing to look at, and the card system is so fun and cute. My main issues with the app are: 1. I wish I could fill out all the cards, being limited to 3 is a bummer 2. I\u2019ve only had the app for about an hour and already I\u2019ve had it freeze or not load all the way like 4 times. It worked fine for maybe 2 swipes and then the message system stopped working, and shortly after that people\u2019s profiles seemed to be only partially loading. The idea of this app and the interface are awesome and I hope that as it gets bigger it will run more smoothly","Ik that this has been said already but the amount of DMs that you can send out are needed to be raised and there is a big problem in my case of the app freezing up my phone. Also when i tried to build up my profile for anything that i need to scroll down for to finish it just doesn't seem to work, now ik if its the app because i can perfectly use other apps and social media platforms.","Lack of users app has to be reset a lot","What is a gay murr","Only has phone as a login option. Uninstalled immediately","I'm awkward, nerdy, and looking for someone who is the same. This app is perfect for me.","You'll be disappointed.","Location is always 4000 miles away","I love the overall aesthetic of the app and how clean everything looks, although I wish that there was a way that I could see all of the people I've liked. Because right now if I miss someone because of the daily dm limit I'll never have a chance to dm them again.","Its just a money grabbing app. Would not recommend.","Anime profile picture required lmao its for real","Hey! There\u2019s a bug that doesn\u2019t allow iPhone users to change their photos from the last update! Please have your QA create a bug ticket to have this fixed in your next update, please and thank you! \u263a\ufe0f","FINALLY! A app where can I can meet girls that relates with my interests. You have no f... idea how very few girl gamers are out there and how over 90% are outdoor social girls. I can't lie to myself and change myself to fit their description. I gotta stay true to myself and be that nerdy gamer guy. Premium deluxe membership will not be bought because lack of people using this app.","I suppose this app fills the niche of people who share the same hobby as you. But unfortunately it's just as money hungry as other apps, trying to get you to pay for a plan to send more than one message a day and only limiting you to 30 people a day. It's also not as popular, so the pool is pretty small.","This is an amazing app when you actually get reply\u2019s but barely get any don\u2019t know how many messages I sent to women and haven\u2019t got any reply\u2019s think it has something to do with infinity membership which you have to have in order to send messages and I think not many women has it, Kippo needs to add an option to chat &amp; text to infinity members because this is an amazing app for gamers looking for that special someone or looking for gamer buddies and the membership not as expensive as most dating apps.","Do we have a different idea of what \"max distance\" means?","BE WARY. Sure you'll see plenty of people to game and chat with but there are a lot of bots and \"romance scammers\" on it, they are easy to spot but still be wary. Definitely a problem with loading and other stuff but if you have hope try it. I wouldn't recommend it myself but to each thier own. There location data is inaccurate and for the most part the DMs are trash.","I couldn't even make an account. You have to sign up with your phone number and it never sends a confirmation code.","I can't even get past the login screen. I enter my number and it never sends a code to my phone.","Mostly used for females and males to promote their social accounts and Twitch. \"I will play games with you but follow my Twitch\" gtfo please. Reporting spam accounts dont seem to work. Couldnt give this app anymore of my time. Lasted a couple of days before uninstalling. 1 DM a day before they ask you to upgrade. 30 profiles a day after the first 100. Forget the dating section...it is a joke. Petition google to remove this app from the store on the way.","It's a good app for making friends or trying to find someone special. The style is pleasing and easy on the eyes and the systems work well, and it's not a meeting app that lies about being free only to lock most of its core features behind a paywall. My only critique is that I wish the app hid inactive members from the feed until they signed on again because I reach out to people on there and rarely get a reply, but when I message them on another app they mention in their profile they reply.","I had a lot of fun using this app I met a lot of people who game with me and I met my now boyfriend","This is a great app if you want to meet new people. You can search for someone to date or set your profile to just friends either way, you'll find someone new to chat and play games with :)","Cant even get past the sign up process want four pictures but everytime I put in the Fourth picture one deletes and its like a infinite loop dog water app","A solid dating app with a straight forward and aesthetically pleasing interface. Population on the app seems low, but I have hopes that can meet someone with similar interests on this app. At the moment I don't feel pressured to spend money or get the premium subscription like most popular dating apps do.","i am fully convinced not a single person is on this app i can\u2019t find anybody i don\u2019t even think bots are in this app","I like the overall premise of the app. It's easy to build a unique profile as this app certainly has things that makes it different from other dating apps. However, the dating pool is really small in my opinion as they're are not a lot of users in my area. I have gone several days in a row with a screen saying I've gone through everyone in my parameters with my range being 20 miles. I've used the app for about 2 months now and not a single match, even after DMing people.","Tinder but with a few gaming themes.","Terrible app","App constantly breaks. Cant read 2nd page bios, messages delete, and app crashes.","Excellent UI and really fun and cute ways to customize your profile. The only thing that kills the all is the lack of users. The main issue that stems from this is the fact that potential matches are recycled multiple time. I\u2019ve swiped on the same account 3x before and just assume they\u2019re doing so in hopes no one notices.","The app alright. However I have a suggestion, allow users to go back through profiles that they already seen. This would help someone like me cause I've already went through everyone within my reach. It would also allow people to give profiles a second thought. This could be apart of the Payed Subscription","The app is good and is good for finding people with common interests, but there is no way to filter people with the only friends option turned on that are just looking for people to watch their streams. If there was a way to filter out people looking for only friends it could be a four at least because you would have less partnered streamers to deal with, but otherwise the user base is too small and repeats users quite a bit every once in a while.","Pool of users is so small. Matching doesn't work and DMs don't work. Nothing about this app works. More options need to be free to build a userbase. What's the point of infinite liking if you run out of people early. Needs an option to see who I liked and see which ones I want to DM and see who likes me for free.","Would really like to see this grow. But for now it is a waste of time.","WAYYYY too limited. One message a day, 20 swipes (approve or decline) and a limited profile system. The only really good part is the game list feature which has an impressive roster of showcase-able games. I don't expect much success from this app. Though after two months of casual use I have begun getting matches.","It's pretty good wish there was more people in my area but what can I do the problem I have is why does it have a bloody pay lock so you have to wait I've always thought that was stupid but good app in the end","Good app just needs more users","I don\u2019t do reviews but this is an exception. This app was cool, but I never matched with anyone, yet for some reason I got banned when I didn\u2019t do anything to be banned for.","Its okay","It is perfectly tailored for gamers. not only do you get to see what games people like, but you also get to see all about them with the card thingys. The app doesn\u2019t plaster the whole Kippo Infinite thing in your face like most dating apps, instead it just sits at the bottom of your screen and does nothing which is awesome. I would however, like the developers advertise the app more. It\u2019s such a great app, has an amazing user interface, amazing concept. It just kinda lacks in people currently. So all the developers need to do is advertise the app and it becomes 10000000 times better.","So it says 17+ I'm 17 and when I put my bday in it said I'm too young","Good app, just not enough people actively use it. In my state at least.","I love it so far just wish it had well more people, everyone i see is over 200 miles away. I live in OH btw. I get most people will be using this in CA","Honestly this app is kind of poo right out the gate, instant sign up issues, it stalls at certain screens, struggles to get to the next step in the sign up process, this has been the kind of app I've been looking for a long time but now not so sure","Pretty alright with how it is currently","It was a really good app that I used a lot but now it randomly says something about a missing value when I try to look at my matches and just loads indefinitely.","Unusable. Currently a bug that doesn't allow messages to refresh due to some missing ID error. Really annoying.","Cannot read or open my messages anymore :/","Just seems like everyone that you see on the app isn\u2019t real or there. Having it for a week and it still is just nothing. There are tons of pretty women but it just seems like they uninstalled the app or were falsely made.","Tried it out. I didnt care for it.","In an add it was targeted twords minors and kids around the age 14 in the add it depicted kids under 14 you need to be 18+ to use this it is not safe for kids","Y\u2019all have some bugs or all the profiles you got on here are duds. No matches in forever, don\u2019t get me wrong not the most attractive person ever but I\u2019ve literally swiped right on everything for couple weeks bc the app seems dead and not a single match....","Have had this downloaded for a couple weeks now, put in a good bit of work into my profile, and not one bit of communication or matches with anyone. Dry app.","This dating app has the right idea but unfortunately it is pretty useless. Most girls are just here to make friends only or they're just using it to advertise their Twitch stream. It's really no different than other dating apps, where the girls are using that to promote their Instagram. Frustrating.","This app is pretty nice but the population is a little on the lower side if you're not trying to look too far out of your area. Also, I feel as though you should be able to look back at the people you've liked in case you end up wanting to dm someone.","Isn't working for me","Fantastic app low user base but, I find myself liking more people here than on any other dating site","Why is it every time I try to add the photos it's stuck in a perpetual only 3 photos after multiple attempts","This is a great app I get matches and people respond to me, it's easy to use I don't feel pressured to buy the premium the 2 problems I have with the app I have is I only get 30 likes or dislikes a day I don't like that disliking someone cost one of your likes the other problem is a small pool I rarely go though my 30 likes a day this is not the apps fault though.","Only works in countries with \"+1\" Code.","Nobody answers even with subscription","Great app they really care about the gaming community","I met my Gaymer wife throu this app i would rate 50 stars if i could.","Theres a bug it keeps not opening up... super annoying cause I found some people I can actually talk to with similar interest...","Great concept, but the range does not work. Set it for 30 miles from my location, instead it still shows thousands of miles away.","I can't even get into the app. I put my number in and no code is sent to me","i suggest that if ppl are using the app just to make friends to play with then they should be given the option to turn their location off. i\u2019m not tryna let everyone know where i live, especially since there r probably groomers on the app. please look over my suggestion and make it happen! app would be much better \ud83e\udd1d","I\u2019ve had this app for 7 days and haven\u2019t matched with a single person. This app is a waste of time","It doesn't send the secret code. Tried another phone numbers and same thing","I haven't had much of a problem with the pool size or people communicating with me. Unfortunately, this seems to be because the app is cycling through the same people. It will be a couple of weeks before the same profile comes back through... but this has happened on multiple occasions. If this is the solution for a low pool count to start with, it is still quite annoying.","I honestly do not believe there are ANY active people on this app. Was here about 3 weeks and there was no communication whatsoever. No likes, no messages, no matches. I'm not expecting to instantly find what I'm looking for but I wasn't expecting to hear crickets either. Deleted account and moved on. No sense in giving permissions to an app that serves no purpose","Pretty good app, really needs the ability to go back and see the profiles you've liked, because you can't always think of a message right away. The \"card\" system is cool but they definitely need to add the ability to put more on your profile, especially with how basic some of them are.","Only usable in big cities and even then only really in the usa","Yo I\u2019ve been on a lot of sites like this and not em take over a week for ur first match msg or anything, plus there is nothing rly else to do on the app, I think it has potential just maybe isn\u2019t working rn...","Its a really cool app and very unique there aren't many of these apps that are this creative and cool. Personally I've had 3 convo's which all ended in utter failure but I'm too stubborn to just give up.","Good app with real people but it takes sooo long to open the app every time. I get a message and have to wait to do that dumb animation every time. Makes me not want to message people. All I want is.","App won't even open on my phone..","Have yet to try it. Stuck on login when asking for code. No code being sent","Just stopped working","Im a woman interested in nonbinaries and women, and despite telling the app this, it kept showing me men","It's a decent app, however 9 times out of 10 it doesn't want to open and just sits on the screen where it says Kippo.","No matches. I might just be generally unlikable but you'd think I'd get atleast one. :'(","30 likes or swipes is far too few, lucky if I find a single profile/user I like per day.","It's alright, I wish you could put more than 3 cards out, the profiles just seem so basic and you can't really get much of a feel for anyone, using more cards would definitely help that. It's an appealing layout to the eye at least.","Absolutely useless app, no active profiles at all. If I could give it a zero I would","I couldn't even get the app to open. I have an s9 so its not like I'm working this on an old phone.","Excellent ui design and layout","The concept of this app is brilliant. The downside, not enough people using it I know I'm not ugly in the slightest bit to not get a single match or dm is ridiculous. I can't most of the women on here are 100% real but the app is so dead I'm sure if were looking for men I would get better results. The app needs to find a way to get more women on the app and also more women that want to date there's an annoying amount of women who are looking for friends smh I've been lucky to have a mix of attractive women on this app with the usual case of fat ones unlike tinder but this app is dead and I can't delete my account there is no option, shady","The 30 swipes a day should be at least 50 or so since the no swipes count. My swipes usually get eaten by a bug or something, where it likes to eat double swipes on one swipe for some reason. If the swipe bug was to get squashed, I'd give 4 stars. I enjoy the app though. Easy to use.","Paid for the one month subscription You aren't allowed to actually write out a profile. You are given these cards and can select certain info to show. You use a slider to set matches within a certain location. After you swipe on all within that area thats it. No one new ever joins. I got maybe two chats that lead to nothing. This app seems like a gamers dream but it is not. Save your money and time.","I am a woman. I have been using the app for two weeks. I have swiped right A LOT. I still have no matches. My guess is that if you do not pay. You get no matches.","The best designed card based dating app I've ever experienced","So I gave this app a try for 1 week, to see if I would get ANY response. I didn't buy any kind of subscription, however even so you'd expect to see something, right? Very wrong. Not a single response from anyone AT ALL. After liking a large amount of people in the more than generous 100 swipes they give, not a single response. Also the match system is buggy. Itll stay stuck on a prof, even if you press skip, and it'll still count toward your limited skips. Overall waste of time and effort.","I can't use the messages. It always says check your internet connection","App doesn't send you the code to register","The app was great I think and just needs more ppl to talk on therw but all in all I liked it","I mean it doesn't seem to be bots but I get nothing. This publisher uses the same services as the match group eugenicists who politically ban along race, gender, orientation lines.","No one responds.","This is a really nice app. I also like that there is a Friends Only option for your profile so it's easy to let people know what you're looking for! I've met some really nice and chill people so far who have already become good gaming friends. I gave it 4 stars because I only wish more people used it so the population pool on it was wider, and I hope with more advertising it gains popularity moving forward!","Thank u for this amazing gamers dating app. Loving it","I just wish you could go back on both hearted and not hearted people...just think of the possibilities!","Mostly catfish, some only want to know what you think of the App.","It would be great if the app would show you people who liked you in your feed first. It would also be great if I didn't see so many minors on the app. I have reported and seen many minors on the app looking for friends and genuinely thinking this app was for everyone. I'm not sure if it's a marketing thing but it says \"dating app\" in the title so I'm not sure where the confusion comes from. Other than that it's an ok app that could be improved.","Can't browse profiles you liked to send messages later. Gotta message right away or you lost your chance. No warning of this. Why even have likes at all?","This app itself is great! I love the \"only friends\" option, but I fail to understand why matches expire so quickly even though you talk to your match. The timer shouldn't go down when you keep talking to the person. There should be a \"block\" option bc you will encounter some freaks (ofc) but the app doesn't let you block them and u can even accidentally match with them again! And last but not least, every once in a while, the app simply fails to load, I get stuck indefinitely on the titlescreen!","I haven't yet had any interactions due to having the ugly, but in the short time I've had the app I can at least say I haven't been attacked by bots and scammers yet, but all these dating apps seem to have a honeymoon phase before they get overrun by scams, but for now it's alright.","The app worked as it was supposed to for the most part, I only have a couple complaints. When I started it was letting me look at 100 profiles a day, but then it was suddenly only 30 for no reason and stayed that way. There was a bug where it wouldn't connect to the wifi and the message would stay on my screen even after I closed the app and turned off my phone. And then of course the fact that hardly anyone uses it, so the options close to me were minuscule. Overall, it does as advertised.","Pretty good","it\u2019s great to be able to meet people either for friendship (or romance) and already have a bunch of things in common! It\u2019s a brilliant idea for an app, and super user-friendly. More than that, I recently moved overseas and had to change my phone number temporarily, meaning I had no way to log in. I emailed support, and not even two days later they rolled out an update that included the ability to log in with apple! So amazing.","So the app is good... But bruh, why am I getting people half way across the continent. If I was getting matches near me I'd give it a five star review","Badly designed app. I tried uploading 4 profile pictures (which you need to create a profile) but when I uploaded the 4th it would delete the previous picture not letting me use the app","I was really excited to try it but this app is really Glitchy. I would be scrolling through people and see matches that would say \"they sent you a message\" but when I go into my messages there is nothing, and there is no match\"","The app in itself is great. It has a lot of room for better potential though. The messaging system is what lacks the most. It takes about a minute for new messages to load in/view them. In-app notifications would be really nice, too.","I feel like its a cash grab my dms never replenish I can't even interact on an that's supposed to be social its illogical why limit interaction I haven't even used a dm in an entire week smh its a design that doesn't even have any benefit to be paid to use.","First off, I just wanna say that this is app is creative with the card system and the whole choose 9 favorite games to display. I actually enjoyed filling all of those out and I looked forward to seeing other people posting their favorite stuff. However, from what I noticed on the reviews on this app (and with personal experience) is that I and some other people haven\u2019t found 1 match, despite having it for some time. I had this app for over 2 weeks now, I still couldn\u2019t find a match. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just a me thing, but it doesn\u2019t feel like it because I tried my best to look attractive to some people and I\u2019ve seen other reviews out there having the same issue. I don\u2019t think my account is even visible on the app because of this. I also dislike the 30 swipes a day deal, even if I\u2019m not attracted to the person and swipe left, it counts as one. Extremely restricting for the user. I understand it\u2019s a small base and it\u2019s at it\u2019s early stages, but c\u2019mon not one match? Even after a couple of weeks? I just feel like this app isn\u2019t good enough to even interact with people, at least not yet, since it doesn\u2019t match you with others. Ironic, since it\u2019s a dating app. This app has potential though.","Just bought Kippo infinite and a couple hours later my account is still srandard.","Never got the secret code. Will probably try again with a different phone plan. I tried to solve the problem. \"Too many requests. Try later.\" When can I try? Will edit review when app works.","Nice UI, but not enough people to get any matches.","Great app but I wish there were more women in my area. Please do more advertising in palm beach! Have someone goto conventions and gaming stores to advertise!","Amazing, 99.9% free app with no ads and an interface that really stands out among other dating apps I've tried. Actually fun to use. But I have a couple suggestions: Archive users' likes so they can view the profiles afterward. I have a couple people I'd love to DM, but I can't because they're cleared from my queue after I liked their profiles. Add an option to cycle through matches again. Perhaps a user changed their mind and saw someone they like in hindsight.","Decent experience building the profile, but it takes forever to load even if you're on Wifi with perfect full bars. Seriously? It's ridiculous, and I've got a feeling they need to update their servers. I'll update the review as time goes on.","It's better now. Some connectivity issues but my matches have gotten 100% better","This app has so much potential but I can tell they don't do updates very frequently \ud83d\ude43","I love the app it's just that i keep trying to add my favorite games on my profile but it never shows whenever i search for games if I'm missing something please tell me","I was told about this app hoping to give it a try but I\u2019m not able to make an account since I\u2019m not receiving the code after I put in my phone number","Best dating app imo, in my area was pretty active and making a profile was fun and intuitive, met the best girl and happily deleted the app. We're about 3 months dating and have a great IRL relationship no cap.","Cant load profiles only get a black screen forever","Hi! So I\u2019ve had this app for about two weeks now. I think the app is great so far. I haven\u2019t had any bug issues so far like some people have. I as a female trying to match with males have had a lot of matches. I found a lot of people I like I really recommend this app. Not everyone on the app is \u201cbad looking\u201d and what I mean by that is that there\u2019s someone for everyone. There is a mix of people both skinny and plus size so there\u2019s someone for everyone. I got a relationship out of this one :) only bad thing I would add is that the profiles sometimes do reappear more that once. Hope this review helps!","Very limited amount of people there, and only made for younger crowd.","Overall a good app but could use some work with optimization and connectivity. I keep losing connection to this app at random times and that gets kind of annoying.","The app itself is pretty simple and easy to get used to. You'll have a lot of fun personalizing your profile as well, and it's one of the few dating apps that isn't constantly reminding you to upgrade to a premium membership (so far). This app does target a very niche demographic, so don't be surprised if hardly anyone else is using it.","This apps biggest issue is it doesn't have enough users. I swiped through my entire pool of people within 100 miles in a few days. I don't see any point in filtering farther than that for dating. The app runs crazy slow but nothing intolerable. Of course, like all dating apps, mileage varies depending on how hot you are. After a month of use my 6/10 self got 2 matches and neither ever responded.","I like this app and I like the general idea, I've made some friends on it as well. I just wish the developers could maybe do more marketing so more people join, just so I could meet some people locally as well","It's a good app but needs a lot of work to compete with the other dating apps, there is no way to check the people you like so there is no way to save a profile for later liking a person just removes your opportunity to talk to them and should be improved or removed.","There's a bug out there with \"please check your internet connection\"...Probably a generic error since my wifi and cell connection works just fine. This is a wonderful app so I hope this gets fixes. Otherwise, this has been a great app to make new friends.","I like the app it's probably the best one out there, best I've used. I do wish they would separate the \"only friends\" and the dating profiles. That is my my number one request that I would like to see in the future. It's kind of annoying having to sort out if this person wants to date or are they just here to socialize and make friends. I feel that just waste of everytones time. I would like to see a dating section and then a friends section that are completely separate from each other","Nice UI and good concept. Only criticism is that profile building would be perfect if you could have Bio and Compatability cards then 3 additional cards instead of being limited to three cards total.","great app, there is just no active users unfortunately.","Liking profiles means nothing. Nobody reaches out. Only 20 seconds a day of profiles so you just can only hope in swipes. Im apparently worthless to ppl and nobody reaches out. I hate the mental game of hoping shes out there. F online dating apps.","They wanted me to put 4 pictures of myself but every time I put the forth in they delete one of my other photos in a never ending cycle couldn't even experience the app","I have tried so many time to get the code to actually sign up have not been able too","You cannot upload a new photo after uploading initial, default photos, so pick your photos very carefully when you first sign up. Also, the preview tab doesn\u2019t work so you won\u2019t be able to preview what your profile will look like before publishing. Pretty crappy bugs that haven\u2019t been squashed.","Way too many girls that just want to be friends. Give me an option to filter out girls with that option turned on because I'm not here for friends and it's ridiculous that over half the people I swipe through have that on they're profile.","Honestly? The best dating app I've used setup wise. It's very sleek, fun to make, you don't have to stress about what to put because the profile decks help you build it, incredible customer response.. I couldn't ask for a nicer app.","After 2 days since creating my account, when opening the app it says \u201clogin with phone\u201d like when you first download it. Despite using the same number it will prompt me to make a whole new account instead of logging me into my previous one. This has happened like 3 times to me and I got the app less than a week ago.","The app is pretty empty (population wise) and frequently bugs out while swiping. It has a good layout and concept, though. Just needs more users.","Cool app, completely ruined by greed. You can only send a single DM per day without paying at least $10 per month, that is ridiculous.","Ultimately, great concept but too many issues with it currently. love the ui, have infinity, etc... But needs more filtering options to match with people... Especially when it seems like every person I've messaged is inactive or something since no one ever responds. I'd like to think I'm very respectful but no one even replies... I just think they don't see it since other comments mention you don't even get a notification until you open the app if someone messages you.","It's okay. Small user base and repeating matches limit it.","Let me just say that I love how this app looks, I also thinks it\u2019s pretty simple to use. I think the idea of the cards is super creative, but I wish there were more kinds of cards and that you could add more than 3 to your profile. I also feel like this app is kinda empty? I mean I\u2019ve used this for 3 days and I\u2019m lucky enough to get the 30 profiles it promises you and they all seem different so I don\u2019t see repeating ones. The limit kinda makes it feel empty tho? I don\u2019t know how many females there are on this app though. I\u2019m a female myself and maybe there\u2019s more males so that\u2019s why I have the luxury of seeing more profiles? I will say that I haven\u2019t seen tons of makes that are attractive to me though. It\u2019s not the apps fault at all, just something to think about if you\u2019re a female wanting to try this app. I could see this more of a social platform to meet other gamers instead of a dating website. The aesthetic doesn\u2019t really fit a dating app, but it does fit an app that will help connect you to more gamers. Think like geek to geek except this app doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s trying to scam you out of money. In short, it looks cool, easy to use, just not a lot of people? Would love if you could find friends on this app in addition to it being a dating app.","Made for USA people only.","Barely anyone on here don't bother, decent format though.","I really want to give it 5 starts but the bugs are just out of hand. I can hardly ever use the app with the \"check you internet\" notice. It won't swipe left sometimes or right or send messages. Pleaseeee fix. It's a great app. But you gotta work out the kinks","The design is really pretty and the cards are a fun to describe yourself. However, as others mentioned before, there isn't a lot of options for filtering. I'd like to be able to filter by language, a specific game or by timezone too. Also I find it harder than other apps to match with people.","I want to give it zero stars, but you can't post unless 1 is selected. I tried to use it, but can never get past the verification screen (beep book beep). I Uninstalled it several times, thinking that would help, but then I enter my number and hit \"next\" nothing happens. After waiting a few minutes I hit it again and get \"too many requests, try again later\", which it still doesn't work. And if I do get a code, I'm still on the phone number screen.","Couldn't even sign up because they never sent the code to my number. Tried multiple times. It seems like a pretty glaring problem when people can't even sign up to use the app.","Cool interface so far, but my profile pictures are showing blank and there's no option/clickable link to make new ones. Just signed up and assuming people are swiping left on my blank profile, please fix","Spent $10 and starting to think it was for nothing. A lot of the profiles don't really see real. Messaged like 50 girls and only 1 had the decency to reply? Somethings fishy cause I'm not that bad looking. Also very limited in area, predicting about 50 women in 45 miles.","Definitely the most interesting of the dating apps if you want to meet a girl that is part of the LGBTQ gender fluid whatever group. Very few \"normal\" women in my location and age group. Has a lot of restrictions unless you pay.","You need a phone number","Would be nice if I got the code to sign up","Great app lots of people listed just waiting for the right person","It was great! People are nice and you can put an \"only friends\" option too so thats cool:)","I don't wish to see or be seen by straight men. Maybe I just totally missed toggling an important parameter at time of onboarding? No support reference exists right now. There doesn't seem to be a setting to change this after onboarding at this time: discovery settings allow for I myself to see men OR women OR non-binary, but I haven't found a compatibility filtering setting. Makes it difficult to know when to \u2764 if the other hasn't set a compatibility card. I'll be watching for new development.","Terrible app, doesn't send the code","I can\u2019t figure what the app is about because my phone is off and I don\u2019t have a number I can receive the code on it would be great if you guys could add a gmail feature so we could access the code from there you know","I met a woman on this app and we hit it off immediately. Results may vary of course. Dating apps do require a bit of luck.","Probably a good app, but not enough people use it","Great app especially for gamers to date and find new friends. I paid for the Kippo Infinite subscription, but I'm finding it's not worth it because there aren't enough profiles to swipe on in my area, which is surprising because I live in Los Angeles. Update: The search preferences glitches out sometimes to where it won't show you all profiles within your set search preference.","Paid user here. I think this app has a lot of potential. I have been actively using this app every day for nearly a month now and I have a suspicion that either my messages are not going through or I don't look good.","The app is well designed and thoughtful. It doesn't feel pandering or like it's talking down to you. The only issue at this point is the population as people who live in lower population cities invariably run out of people quickly and it's unrealistic to match with someone more than 50 miles away. I'm sure this will get better with time but just be aware of it going in. Otherwise, the best experience I've had on a dating app.","As other have alluded too, I\u2019m not seeing many people on it. But I\u2019m being a little more critical here with my review because I\u2019d rather get through 10-15 and be told \u201cno one left to see\u201d rather than having the same number of people show up 3-4 times.","Really awesome dating app for gamers it would be 5 stars if they added in these features, I'd love an option to only match by card results so say I only want to see people who chose the card that says they play on xbox, and with an infinity membership I'd love an ability to see who liked you before you even like them","Fantastic concept and stellar execution! The limit to the amount of times your can \"swipe\" per day always keeps you engaged and coming back to see who and what is new. The presentation is far out, and while some effects aren't very optimized for my slightly dated phone, they're sure to draw you in like they did me. My only complaint? POPULATION. You guys need to throw some ads out there and get more attention because you have a winner of an app here!","No immediate matches and those who wanna talk with me either want my snapchat or don't even share the same interests with me","App is laggy and there are 0 matches","Really enjoying my time on here:) lots of people to meet and talk to!","Waste","Fun! I love this app and wish more people would use it. I love how you set up your profile. Its been my favorite compared to other apps like Tinder or Hinge. So glad to find an app where everyone already has one thing in common. Gaming! I do think that maybe there is a bug with the matching? I just so happened to get a message from someone on another app (reddit) who said we matched on Kippo but it never showed up for either of us.","Good idea, needs more advertising to pull in people, unfortunately.","It's a bit rough. The direct message box keeps deleting everything I wrote every time I scroll away, and attempting to scroll horizontally on a carousel will often scroll the entire page vertically instead. Matches are often slow to load, forcing you to tap several times to accept or reject. At the end of the day it's just another Tinder-like dating app. Someone please just make a dating app with a grid layout of people (NOT one person at a time), extensive filtering options, and a search bar.","So far I've been enjoying it. The ui is super cool and easy to use. The only real problem I have is that I don't get push notifications even though they're enabled. It doesn't tell me I have a message until after I've opened the app","It\u2019s just dead... little over 2 weeks and not a single match on 500mi+ distance","I don't take a lot of pictures. Not too photogenic. Can you make it so we can continue with at least just 2 pictures? Maybe even one? I understand y'all don't want any catfishes. Cool. I'm not one. But I don't like taking pictures, and since I only have two pics of me, I cant even make a profile because I don't have four pics with my face, and yall require that for me to have a profile.","I love the idea the only problem is I can even make an account. I tried many times to have it send a code to my phone but it cant even handle that Wich is why I give this app one star.","This seems like a cool concept but is ultimately pointless because you have a limited amount of profiles to look through each day. I\u2019m not gonna pay for what\u2019s free on every other app...","Current update broke the app. Other than that it's not bad for meeting gamers","Love the idea and the UI of this app, even if I don't get matches lol. My only issue is that recently I have been getting an error about and \"undiscoverable user\" or something to that effect that makes it impossible for me to view other profiles (making the app useless) and leaves the error message on my screen for about 10 minutes. The error persists despite power cycling my phone. If this issue is resolved I will return and update my review. Edit 2/5/21: the app is working again! Tysm :)","The app is great. My only gripe is that more people don't use it. With a lower price for premium services than most, being geared towards gamers like me, and have a visually appealing look, the fact that I've run out of people to swipe on while using Infinite mode on day 2 is kind of a bummer. This is not a dig at the app, but you guys gotta advertise yourselves more or something. Get more people using this app!","As soon as I made my account it sent me like a million text messages to my phone number so I deleted my account and now they won't stop texting me to download stuff and jts from a different number everytime HELP","Cute app; just not ready to date again like I thought. Also seems like there's not a ton of users yet. Maybe advertise a little more? Like thru twitch? Idk.","No way to turn off premium","I started using the app a couple days ago and it\u2019s been glitching the entire time. Eventually I found two matches I wanted to dm but I ran out of messages so I paid for Kippo premium and as soon as I did, the app glitched, and I didn\u2019t get to send a match to either of the people. I doubt I would have wanted to use the premium on anyone else so now I\u2019m down $10 and I didn\u2019t get to sue it for the reason I wanted to","UPDATE: App is a disappointment. 30 swipes is still a joke. Frequently refuses to connect. Today for the second time it just ate all my swipes because it couldnt connect and tells me to come back tomorrow. Whats with peoples names being a string of numbers? Theres still no way to filter results. In 3 months Ive had ONE match. No clear indication that someone has liked you.","i have my age range set from 18-22, since i\u2019m 18, yet i still get people MUCH older than that range messaging me. if you\u2019re going to let us set an age range, it would be nice if it also restricted the people who see me on the swipe to only those ages. because 37 year old men in my inbox make me uncomfortable; i set an age range for a reason.","This app is cool in theory, but from having used it for a while, it seems completely devoid of active users. No likes or matches, but hey, maybe it\u2019s my fault. At any rate, I\u2019m uninstalling, but maybe you\u2019ll have better luck than I did. Good luck if you try it.","I installed this app to hate my life a little less and stayed for the phenomenal user interface.","Why isn\u2019t there people in age range of 14 to 16 it\u2019s just a bunch of older people \ud83d\udc80","The app experience is amazing to say the least. Everything flows very well and the design lenguage can be found across all of its pages. There's two things that need work. First of all, I'd like it if this app did some sort of advertising with Instagram or Snapchat so more people can join the app and make matching easier. Secondly, it'd be cool if they added integration for more game stats (even if you had to input the manually.) Overall great app and a WAY BETTER alternative to some of the other tinder like apps for gamers.","Empty App. Limited selections. Interface isnt that friendly. Nowhere to delete account...","Phone number option only really","Closest person to me is over 1000 miles","Also bad. Nobody seems to use this app","Some unique features, however if you have 5 swipes left for the day and don't use em. Guess what you only have 5 the next day as well cause they don't reset to 100 a day. Which brings me to my next problem. You only get 100 a day. Either yes or no","I used to have hepatitis B until I downloaded this epic gamer dating app. I thought there was no hope for me in any way to get an epic gamer girlfriend who loved GFuel and anime video gaymes like me. But one day I saw her, looking as beautiful as a setting sun. We got to know each other a bit to play some games, and when she flamed the team by calling them duisgustinhg fuvktards i knew she was the one. I\u2019ve been paying her and her boyfriends bills for months now, I\u2019ve never been happier until now, being called her number 1 simp","The claim for ALL gamers us a FLAT LIE. ONLY VIDEO GAMES ARE ALLOWED. If you like dice and paper, you are not welcome.","So unless you want to find maybe 10 people kind of close and none of which take care of themselves even remotely, don't bother. Plus it's for like no features for browsing people. Once you've liked/disliked or messaged someone, they're gone for ever. So you get thru the 10 near you and the app becomes useless","Every code it sends me to even log in is invalid or expired the second I receive it","Won't send me a code at all A grade app you got here","I downloaded this app and I met someone AMAZING in about a week and a half. The limited swipes are annoying but honestly I'm grateful because it allows you to take your time with each match and get to know them. With hinge and tinder and fb dating I would more matches and \"hey\" messages than I could actually interact with. The person who stands out upon first impression may not be the one. Just the one who stands out. The man I matched with is now on his flight home after an amazing visit \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f","Can't even create an account, I entered my phone # and it won't send me the code","This app is ideal in it's layout and execution. The main problem is that it's laggy and buggy like Cyberpunk2077, but I mean we're gamers. We can handle bugs xD The minor problem is that the community is small, but that's really our fault if we aren't signing up &gt;_&lt; The free version is very limited, but the price to upgrade is way more reasonable than other apps \ud83d\udc4c You can't share links though :c","It's getting better with updates. Sucks that its 30 matches a day regardless of like or not but oh well. Recently been experiencing a lot of connection issues, and it's been gradually getting worse.","It doesn't load right half the time i have to back out of the app like 4 times to see the messages","It has a good concept, but it lacks users. I had maybe 15 users around me (20 miles) before I had to keep expanding to 50 miles just to see more people","What a mess of an app. Barely functional","This is a really unique dating app. I think the cards are a great idea and overall I love the look and layout. I just wish more people were using it! Can be a little slow at times in the matching screen.","Half the time this app doesn't even work. It gives me a \"please check you internet connection\" error when my connection is fine. It works in every other app, browser, speed test, etc. When I restart the app it'll take half or all of my swipes away as if I already used them.","I have been using this app for a while and it\u2019s alright. For some reason the app logged me out and I changed my number of the app and I can\u2019t get back into my account. It would be nice to have a back up login so you don\u2019t get locked out of the people that you\u2019re talking to.","For some reason I can't make account It says sending code and I get no code bin dealing with it since yesterday","Their profiling is easy to setup and makes sense. Easy to view others however app falls extremely short since you only get to view a profile ONCE. No way to go back to view people you might\u2019ve been interested in once you passed them. Then when you exhausted all the people(same if you pay for premium so don\u2019t waste a single dime on this) your stuck with nobody to view for days unless you expand the scope of what your looking for. If you looking for only people nearby don\u2019t waste your time. The unlimited viewing is a complete waste of money since you can just wait a few days going through profiles that you will never see again anyway.","After a few days of them giving to 100 cards, they start giving you thirty. Plus you don't get any matches, nor DMs. (Or I'm ugly \ud83d\ude02). And that \"please connect to the internet\" is annoying but that's just a mistake","Best dating app for gamers. Amazing Interface and theme. Lots of people to talk to. Great app!","There's great things going for this app but the amount of bugs and \"internet connection\" problem is making it frustrating","I've tried adding photos multiple times and it just tells me my account isn't verified. Then I log in it and tells me my number isn't verified.. after I've already verified.. good luck working this issue out..","I never got an activation code for my phone number","I love this app","Very easy to use.","The fact that you need a phone number to create a account is stupid you should only need a email. I no longer have a phone number because I lost my job and can't find another due to the Corona virus.","Very nice app","Nice app really helpfull","Really good","Nice app. Very useful app","Honestly not a whole lot of customization to your profile no way to say your lgbtq or use different pronouns so not good for lgbtq cant say mich about yourself not a lot of customizing what your looking for. Limits how many people you view at one time no location indicators honestly not a full dateing ap i want to stick with it for now to see if they update it later but its hard to match with anyone i dont think many people use it","The cards + UI is sweet, but it doesn't feel like a dating app, and feels more like a showcase of cool \"cards\" and fav games. The cards serves no actual purpose, as you can barely add any info about yourself on them. The profiles all end up repeating the same cards and gets boring quickly to look at because there's nothing authentic to see for each individual. It's like we're all showing off our rare pokemon cards, except we all have the exact same cards. It doesn't offer any sort of uniqueness","Cool","Best app my vote 7 stars","Excellent Quality","Awesome working","Don't get it. It sucks.","Very helpful. best app","Im loving this app","Wonderful experience","Pure dog","Whenever I tried to launch the app it would only show the Kippo logo and wouldn't load past that. I tried uninstalling the app and redoing everything but it would only launch properly when I had a notification.","The interface is nice, but the app is a ghost town.","Best ever! Always works great.","Useful for me.","Reached the daily limit two days ago and it hasn't refreshed.","This is helpful","Why get anything else","Experience is good","Working great","App is functional and has some good features to set it apart from the rest. However, passing on someone costs the same as sending a like (30 free a day), which makes it to where you essentially hit like on everyone. Most dating apps don't count passes against your daily limit.","It takes agesss for it to load. Loading my messages? Almost impossible I have to wait so long and then they don't load when I send them either ha really slow app just switching from swiping to messages takes so long and then opening it too.

Did the update this morning and getting service unavailable, hopefully it's fixed soon","Honestly, an amazing app with a great interface. Two issues for myself: I'm gay and it would show me straight men in my suggestions, which was a huge turn off. My suggestion is to either fix their algorithm or just have the compatability card be a mandatory card in the top of a person's bio. And the second thing is just a sheer lack of people on the app right now for it to be worth a lot of time.","It is cool to use","ALL THE BEST","Does not want to launch every time I open the app","After being on here for a while I got no matches and no conversations, how disappointing","Very nice app. easy to use","Nice app for me","Great app. Lower priced premium than all other competitors as of January 2021 and really premium isn't a requirement if your patient.

But until it takes off it\u2019s just hard to get any matches.","Like the general format a lot, saves me the trouble of looking for someone nerdy who matches the other things I'm looking for.

I don\u2019t understand why their is a limit to how many people you can see per day, not even matches per day. I probably swipe on 1 person per 30, if that sometimes.

I have gone through the entire user base within 5 years of my age within 75 miles, but haven't matched with anyone yet. The cost is much better than other apps imo. I have higher hopes that this will result in something. The only thing I would like is the ability to review my likes so I can direct message folks that I didn't initially do so with. I definitely say give it a shot and help build the userbase.","Best dating app ever! As a gamer love kippo dating app.","Good. thank you.","Superb performance l like it","awesome aap","Just started and so far so amazing. Very easy to create your profile with its unique and creative design. This is an app that should be advertised on Twitch amongst other gaming outlets. Need to see more people on here.","So for in my experience is a three. I do really like how they do the profile my only issue is that out of 30 people they were all 2k miles away for me. I'll try the app for a few more days if I only get people so far away I'm going to have to just drop this app.","Good experience","It is very very useful","Im honestly impressed hope they keep it up","Super Super App","Great App thanks","I keep getting matched with people across the border, I'm in British Columbia but I keep getting matched with people from Washington. Due to covid that makes things SUPER inconvenient.","Very nice app thanks","Nice and excellent","Keep up the good work","I like it thank you","why isnt osu on the list??? plz hlep","This app is actually pretty cool at first. Its focused on gaming and stuff and you can mark your favorite games so you have something easy to start convos with. The app isnt super relationship focused which is nice so you can talk casually. There needs to be alot more tabs to let you place games you play though, let us put a bunch and make it a \u201csee more\u201d option after the first 9 that you have now. But the worst decision is you can only swipe 30 people each DAY. So you hop on for like 2 minutes and then bye. What an odd choice. I get all these apps always have a bunch of things like this but cmon, the most basic key feature is what youre going to limit? Makes the app almost not worth using since you barely can see anyone that uses it.","100 percent","Just used my profile last night now when I open the app it tries to get me to make a new account even though I use the same number.","Easy to use","VERY useful!","Great app to have on hand","Finally its available on Android!! I\u2019ve waited for so long","Good useful better than others.","Very nice job","Very good Best I can say","The app is super well done, from a design stand point. But due to lack of users and opportunities to like someone (daily limit of 30 swipes), there\u2019s not much incentive to use this over any other dating app.","Sleek app, surprised at how well it\u2019s made I haven't really seen animations like these in a dating app","This is very good apps.","Cant even make an account. Will not allow to add images to continue process. All permissions allowed on a galaxy s10. Hoped to try it out.","It's pretty good","It is a very usefull app","This app got me into main Hecarims. Nice and intuitive interface. Problems with notifications sometimes.","That's very awesome and very helpful","It's really very impressive to everybody","it seems like they are going for a futuristic game feel. honestly has potential really curious to see where they are going to take it. I love how animated stuff within the app is they should do it for all cards","Helped very much","Memorable experience with this App","I like it, but I wish I could go back through my likes to possibly send direct messages. I didn't realize there were so few people in my area and thought I would have a bigger pool of people to chat with.","No one is on this thing. or it's just filled with bots.","Very Good Very Good","I like it so much","App doesn't work. I gave it permission to access my location and got an error message. Then when I exited out of the app and tried to get back on it didn't let me. Don't waste your time.","It was amazing","every update has sick features","Great Amazing","First app I\u2019ve ever used where after one and a half months of use I have not a single match. This will hopefully change if more people join but as of now the limitations on swipes and profile views make this app not really worth your time. There are better apps to find women.","It is very very useful","Very nice application","excellent application for all","Awesome does what it says","The app feels like a game your profile is created with cool effects","Can't get past the part where it asks to share your location, would like any info on how to get past that \ud83d\ude05","Not working despite allowing all permissions","Exactly as advertised, Kippo has made a great app for gamers to try and meet. My only gripe is that while I'm close to the Canadian border, I would only like to date people in the US. I wish I could filter for my country only! Dating cross country is too complicated for me.","Best application","Great utility","its beautiful apps","Its very good app for us thanks","It is excellent","Amazing experience","The app only shows me people between 500 and 3000 miles away. Really unsatisfied with the fact that there's no way to filter out the people too far.","Very beautiful","big fan of apps in the dating space just being different","Wonderful app ever seen","Great opportunity","I can't even get a message to use the app. There should be a alternate way then recieving code by text.","Very bright light","Amazing and safe app","Works great, and I like the features as well","It's Amazing","Impressively handy","this is app is my angel","I enjoy the concept, but there are no interactions.","This app is garbage it won't even let me sign up. I got to the part where it says to turn on my location settings for the app, and then it won't let me proceed further than that. It just pulls up an error and then closes the app with the message, \"Kippo has stopped\". I've gone through the profile creation process 4 times and it's giving me the error message every time. DO NOT DOWNLOAD! COMPLETE AND UTTER WASTE OF TIME AND SPACE!!! If I could I would give this zero Stars.","Very Good Very Good","IT'S WORKING","Does its job","It's nice loved it","This is so good","The app has a beautiful interface and a good prospect. There are few bugs here and there which will get eventually fixed. But to increase the authenticity and reduce dating scammers from this app having an option to sync xbox live or PS+ accounts will be amazing. In that way we can compare our level in the games that are common between the match.","Amazing app i love it really","Really need that swipe limit changed. Follow something like Hinge and have it only count for likes. Bot and fake accounts use up a lot of my swipes! Could also use space other than the bio card to specify smokers, drinkers, and 420-ers as well as having children or any other specific, common parameters.","So far so good! It's actually a good app! Just needs to grow its user base. I was pleasantly surprised with this app and will definitely be staying on board!","Best app in the industry by far","No problems on my galaxy","Very much helping Thanks","Many accounts are inactive, I've been on for 3 days and not even a single match, like, or message from anyone near me, disappointing","OMG they have all the games I play!! And the cards are so pretty","Pretty good app","Great Tool","The only dating app to actually get me a date... Some things to improve: option to filter out people who just want friends. The app also has to reopen anytime I switch out of it, making it difficult to go back into convos quickly.","Very very useful","Very very very very very very very very very nice","As a developer, I was immediately impressed with the responsiveness, slick UI, and overall design of this app. Whoever developed this deserves a raise! Looking forward to seeing this improving even more as additional features are added. My only complaint so far is the membership, which I will not be getting due to how overpriced it is. Other dating apps give you much more bang for your buck.","The greatest","Does the job well","Great app. Very helpful.","Easy to download and use","Its very good app for us thanks","its not letting me login the app froze","International","Cyberpunk meets dating app the cross-over of the century","Usually not a fan of dating apps but I like how they have animations and cards to highlight your profile it's not just text and pictures","Use it all the time.","Would like to try the app but when i try to log in using my number, i dont get a verification code until like 30min after i had sent a request","Wonderful app Good product","I like this app","Giving 5 star cause they actually helped me over Twitter","Easy to download and use","great app!","Tried this app because I was sick of flipping through Tinder... the cards system of Kippo is a really great idea!!

I hope I can find a proper match. :)","Very bright light","Bad experience for me","I have yet to get a single match. I usually pull in a few on other dating apps within the first few days. I filled out my profile 100%. Im guessing the user base is dead?","Great app of the world","App is broken","Excellent app!","One of the best app","Just installed. Very impressed","Great profile creator, I wish there was more matches to swipe on though. I wasn't under the impression that \"no\" swipes were using up my daily limit, I think you should make that more transparent. Other than that it seems good, I actually see people with similar hobbies. Even if they're across the continent","I'm really satisfied to use this app","Ugh, I don\u2019t even need this app anymore!! I\u2019m only rating five stars because of the cute, nerdy user interface and widgets. Oh and because I met my cute, nerdy boyfriend on it. So now I don\u2019t need it anymore. Good luck to all the lonely gamers in the world. Try Kippo and maybe you won\u2019t be lonely for much longer. (:","Works really good","it's wonderful app","Its good so far","this is such a good app","It is cool to use","Best application","Got it. good","this really helps me","Keep it up devs, this app is well made, has cool features, is secure with an option to flag bots, and has a focus on gamers. it\u2019s honestly better than 99% of dating apps out there. Just needs 1) more people, and 2) a way to connect with gamers that play the same games. If we could meet people that play the same online games easily, it doesn\u2019t matter as much that there aren\u2019t so many people in our immediate geographic area. I think a lot of gamers would be fine with meeting people and connecting further over games, especially with the whole COVID thing going on.

Which is very weird) awkward, plus taking up a space in the free use. The app is alright, I like that they have an only friends option as well, but yeah, hate that just because you wanna answer what someone says then it matches you etc. Instead of giving an option to match or not. And have a separate inbox etc etc. Aka, have a separating friend and match area maybe. That would be nice.","cool beans cool design","Great app I like this app","trash","App is good.","I love it. I Love it","Dating should def be more like gaming - just fun","Working app","Why does it need my phone number my email isn't enough?","Very very best app","I wanted to try the app out but for some odd reason I can\u2019t even get past the log in screen cause when I enter my phone number, I wait for the code but it never gets sent to me. I say I didn\u2019t receive it and still do not get a code.","so very good 5 star","This app is very useful","A lot of fun so far. Not a fan of the intro screen. (Flashing lights give me a headache) others that that, it's actually pretty good. You only get like 30 likes a day though.","Trying it out and this app is already a million times better than Tinder. I was interested in almost everyone it showed me instead of swiping through hundreds of people who are almost total opposites. Mainstream apps are not for us, and we need one that reflects the social circles we frequent in real life. It's also a very professional app that's on the level of other larger ones. Hoping my impressions are lasting ones.","its beautiful apps","Good app, wish I could find a girl that wants an animal crossing date as much as me- just gotta keep it up!","Wow they actually put in thought and effort to how a dating app should look","it's interesting","Im giving it one star for the main reason this app was made for, to MEET people yet guys will get no matches what so ever. Tbh I wouldn\u2019t recommend this to anyone and if you can\u2019t even get one match without paying what\u2019s the point to go premium.","This is the dating app every gamer has been waiting for. Before Kippo, your only options were generic dating apps that obviously had no correlation with people relating to the gaming realm. You're no longer a minority here, and that's why this app is worth the merited try. You might be worried about the 3.5 stars, and like every other app, there's bugs here and there. The team has been taking care of those in the couple months I've been using the app. The notable smaller user base argument is accurate, but this app has only been live for over a year. The free tier only allows 30 swipes a day (regardless of right and left), which you could argue is low if you're an active dater, but a pretty standard number for the average Joe. A huge highlight in the swipe process is the ability to send a message instead of swiping. A majority of my matches were from sending initial messages. Utilize that feature as much as you can. Kippo profile customization is quite unique. You've got your normal picture section, a section where you can add your favorite games, and various panels to express yourself. Overall, a featureful and visually beautiful app. I've had Infinity (paid tier) for about three months now, and I've found incredible people both in my area and across NA.","Good and happy","Nice app ever seen","one message a day? that's so damn cheap. don't make a free app if it's so crippled you can't even use it without paying. what a waste of time","Best app in my life","Won't even send me the text message so I can sign up. Tried absolutely everything I could think of. A complete waste of 30+ minutes.","Nice app. I'm happy with this one","I'm not even sure how to use this app. I've had it for a day and no \"matches.\" Uninstalling which is too bad because this idea is cool.","Love it does exactly what it says!!","Best very good","Brilliant for me","Really helpful","Way not enough people, I barely did 100 match and in already out...","I just got a notification that I received a message, but upon opening the app, I did not see any messages. I've seen similar complaints, and if this is a recurring problem, it needs to be addressed immediately. Not much point in a dating app where you can't message people.","I don't know why my review was removed but here it is again without the description I had on it before because I can't remember what I wrote.","It seems cool and its designed well I like the focus on gamers but more info does need to be displayed about a person and also there aren't enough swipes, its like playing free to play games where there's a limited amount of time you can play per day or like having parental controls on a dating app :/ It forces you to use your location like every dating app but it shows you people that are thousands of miles away from you, what's the point?","Good works great.","I waited forever for this on Android and its better than I thought I can\u2019t wait till they add more new cards","The fact I couldn't just used my email was a problem.","Excellent app thanks","It's a great Idea but it could be so much more. It would be better of there was a dating and friend options and I wish there was an option to look up a game and see other users who also play it. To play the game with and make friends.","Well I like the concept but I dont like this app. 1 you dont get to see how many people liked you 2 you only get 30 swipes if your going free 3 I dont think the swiping system actually works I swiped on 30 girls a night for 10 nights now and only 1 match. That's is 1 girl every 10 nights. I also think there is alot of abandoned accounts that you have to swipe left or right on so boom their goes like potentially all your likes that day so I dont recommend it","App is very important","Love it, I\u2019ll challenge anyone to Overcooked or Smash ;D","Great technology","I am currently paying for the premium and some suspect things are going on. Before i paid almost every girl i ever messaged with the 1 free daily message they responded to. I think only 1 once didnt. But now, as a paying member i can message unlimitedly. ive probably messaged close to 100 people and only 1 has responded. How could i go from getting a message back every time to suddenly a 1% answer rate once im paying to send more. seems very suspect like the messages dont go through.","love this thank you","Great experience","Very wonderful and awesome","Pretty good only have 2 problems so far 1. Swiping right and saying no shouldnt be counted aginst you 2. Not enough swipes for a day this is my first day and i used it all in 10 mims would be nice for free unlimited swipes or having swipe right not go aginst you Something i really like is there are real people on this app they all look geuinie. Also even if you dont play games you could probally find someone on here Location and age filiter are really good.","No idea what\u2019s going on with the app, I\u2019ve gotten plenty of matches on other apps, and filled out everything I could here, if I\u2019m not gonna be getting matches, I should at least be getting requests to game at least right? Instead I\u2019m getting no responses from the one daily allotted DM I can send to girls on the app, and 30 likes or skips and still no matches after weeks of active searching. Developers have either gotta add more features like filters by game or compatibility based on the types of games I play or I\u2019m gonna have to dip.","The app itself isn't badly constructed, but no one in it talks. It's a lot like Tinder in it's set up.","First impressions: Original, Fun, Simple to use UI, diffrent and made for Gamers and seeking for Gamers. No memes in pictures, Not a joke like tinder and messages can be sent,","Had the app for about a month. First off not many people on it in Tennessee and second off i messaged some and liked many and nothing. Not worth it","So, the messaging limitation sucks, unsure if there's one for responding to messages, and there is a severe need for people to all have bios, thats not hidden in a card, everyone gets s bio, whether they fill it is another story. Its gkt potential, abd its cheaper than other apps but I dont know if people actually check this one. We'll see.","Genuinely one of the better looking dating apps out there. The profile customization is really fun too. I hope more customization is added, like being able to add favorite movies/shows/anime/books ect...The only thing holding it back is lack of users and the strictness of swipes (why am I losing swipes for swiping left??). Despite this, it's worth making and keeping an account up, with the hope that the user base grows. Edit: DM amount should be extended. Changing to 4 stars because of that.","I would give it a better rating, but it doesn't open. I tried giving it permissions for location and even storage, but it didn't work.","I wanted to use this app. I have installed it 2 times. It will not open. This is garbage.","Downloaded the app, profile setup was easy and I really liked the idea of the cards, started liking other profiles. The problem occurred when I tried to access my profile the next time and my profile was gone and I was being prompted to make a new profile. I could be just a one off but this was annoying, but I do like the idea and what they\u2019re trying to accomplish.","Cant give a proper review since the app doesn't even open for me! :( a message pops up and says, 2 exceptions occurred. Help please !!","It would be very helpful if you would allow me to dm people I'm interested in after I hit yes. And not make me miss the chance to dm if I like someone but am busy.","STUPID APP AND NOBODY USES IT......","I can't open the app its just says 2 exceptions occurred?","This is honestly such a cool app; it's an amazing idea. Unfortunately it really only works well in more metropolitan areas where the nerd communities are much larger","Lame. Dead no one near me. Always glitched","Not enough people on the app just yet but you are mostly getting gamers so that's to be expected. Only problem I have with it is they have to update the games regularly for the cards.","App doesn't work? The UX is so nice and seems nice! But nothing loads and it takes forever to.... I keep getting notifications but my app won't even open! I really do want to use it.","It's a nice idea, but my problem is that once you go through all the profiles in an area that's it. No seeing a profile again that has been updated later.","Unable to permanently delete account. As far as I know the only way to do so is through the app, and when I try I get an error message. Pretty fishy :/","App was pretty good. However since I got a new Iphone whenever I enter my phone number i don\u2019t get a text to login. Guess I just can\u2019t use the app anymore.","I like it a lot but lately I get the little blue dot by the chat bubble that I assume is to notify u that u got a dm or reply but when I click on it nothing shows up","When I request authentication code and put it in it always says the codes are wrong I'll even request multiple codes.","Lotsa potential. can't copy text from other's messages tho? I'm not going to enter that music recommendation Spotify link manually lmao","Preemptively rating this one star considering it only lets you see 30 profiles, most of the bios are pseudointellectual garbage like sign and the 4 letter personality type (just put an IQ test in there too, the science is the same), and I already know that like every other dating app this isn't going to work for losers like myself. I'm giving it a try, but typically these are money sinks for gullible men and ego inflators for women. Congrats on your success, rodents. Edit: doesn't work at all","App crashed 2 days ago and still won't load up","Really love the UI, super cool to see something designed for gamers. Great app for meeting new people!","im a girl gamer which I\u2019m reading this app doesn\u2019t have enough of.... well I downloaded this app. The first thing it makes you do is log in with you phone number. The code it\u2019s suppose to send to your phone never came through. Deleted and downloaded the app and still doesn\u2019t send me a code so i can\u2019t even sign in. Fix your app","Not LGBT friendly. There is no way to filter preferences, so you are probably swiping likes on people not interested and getting messages from people you wouldn't be interested in.","Its a solid concept. I gave it a try for a couple weeks but i didnt get a single match, whereas on other dating apps i do get matches. Its hard to justify limiting swipes when you are getting no matches. I think it needs to become more popular before limiting.","This is actually a charming app. It\u2019s obviously in its beginning stages though with such a tiny user base. It\u2019s so new you can get a \u2018founder\u2019s badge\u2019 for being the first to sign up for the paid service which is fairly priced imo compared to other competing apps. Downside: if you don\u2019t pay it\u2019s only 30 swipes a day which is reality is a decent amount but realistically takes a few minutes of swiping then that\u2019s it. It counts swiping left or right as one of the 30 uses per day - just food for thought. Okay - so is the ROI there yet to use it. Depends on your outlook of things. I\u2019d say build a profile and swipe occasionally. The app is growing for sure but TINY right now. If you\u2019re in a big city you\u2019ll still run out of people to swipe on incredibly quick. However, if this apps takes off it will be a fantastic user experience for all parties involved. So check it out - but don\u2019t expect anything (literally) for awhile. I\u2019m giving it 3 stars for it being empty - which isn\u2019t inherently the app\u2019s fault - but it does effect the user\u2019s experience seeing absolutely no traction on their profile.","i saw them roast someone on Instagram\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23","Although it's a nice design they lost me at forcing me to add my phone number and overpriced premium with hardly any users I was hoping for it not to be another money monster for now I will stick to the less expensive options atleast be honest and say that the app hasn't fully populated instead of acting like there is so many options with so little people and greed shouldn't be the motivation in a new app but that's just my opinion maybe I will come back a later date.","I wish you could sign up with your email or something instead of just using your phone number\ud83d\ude15","I like the concept of this app but I absolutely hate how our profiles show our location. As a woman that is very disconcerting, I live in a small town and I'm not comfortable with putting out there where I live. deleted my profile and uninstalled the app for this reason alone. Maybe if we are given the option to keep our location to ourselves unless we decide to disclose it then I might redownload. Until then I'd rather not.","I think overall Kippo is okay. It helped a lot once they added cards that you can write on. I appreciate a dating app made for gamers, but the population on it isn't great. Kippo can't necessarily choose how many people download the app though. Contrary to many other reviews, I actually like that I can only like/dislike 30 profiles a day on the free version because it keeps me from spending too much time hopelessly scrolling through countless profiles that will lead nowhere for me","It has really cool features, and seems pretty legit. But I havent had hardly any matches. I like at least 20 dudes a day and look in my matches and its a ghost town.. As opposed to Bumble or Tinder where I feel like every other person I swipe right on I get matched with. Im not sure why that is. I wish there was a way to see who you liked so you can just go ahead and message them without having to match. In my opinion its likely because a lot of profiles are bots.","Good concept, needs improvements as well as more diverse ways of expressing yourself. 1 DM a day is incredibly frustrating. It makes you nervous about using it up incase someone is not LGBT as well. It needs more people and better opportunities for matches. As well as being able to see who you've already hit the heart for in case you'd like to go back and DM someone.","I NEVER GOT ANY MATCHES.","I may come back to this app, it\u2019s just not for me and when I do get on, I\u2019m given the same users and why bother people if they have no interest? I\u2019d rather just leave them alone instead of being a \u201ccreep\u201d maybe the demographic isn\u2019t great for my city and likely this app may be better in another city, or my luck is just (bleep), oh well. A lot of profiles there just don\u2019t seem complete and I can\u2019t tell if they\u2019re real or just some pics from the internet they slapped on.","Edit: Changed rating to 4 stars, update has been nice, and thank you for your response. Still wish you could write a bio without using a card though, but that's just my preference perhaps. I'm excited to see this app grow even further in the future!","I absolutely love this app, I have yet to get a match because of the abismal user count. But this app is elegant and very well made. While YES it's has a subscription if you want to have more than the limited about of matches, I think the price is really fair for the time the Devs took to make the app so tailored to gamers and make it as beautiful as it is. I will say the limited number of likes/nos you have is actually a blessing if there's not a while lot of people in your area on the app","I'm gay why can men see me a message me theres no way for me to block men completely.","Solid and creative concept I thoroughly enjoy the look and feel of the app, it has a clever way of allowing you to customize your profile, without drowning visitors to your page in excessive nonsense. The only down side this app has currently is it's lack of users. This isn't necessarily a problem, because as of writing this I believe the app is still relatively new and is likely to grow quickly among the ever widening gaming community.","Amazing. There should be more apps like this","It's definitely getting there. I dont think people know there is a button to write a bio, but it s under write a haiku. Make that more obvious for people. Also, lose the 30 people per day only thing. Dont put the bio as a card. Put is as something optional, but separate from the cards. Include more games. Games like lego star wars and VRchat are not there. Put an option to personalize each person s role in a game. I wish i could write more but word limit is a thing.","Optional.","Really helpful.","I love it its very usefull","Better then I expected","very useful app","No one replies. The app is dead. I got only 30 people a day. No matches. Its for gamers but is NOTHING about gaming. I can't delete my account too.","So when I try to make a new card it cuts off and I can't even fill it out.","Conceptually, this is a very interesting way to approach dating apps. I like the customizable cards and the ability to link up to nine of your favorite games to your profile. The low number of photos you can submit of yourself (up to four) may be a turn off for some, but I personally prefer it. HOWEVER, this app is held back by two major factors: a low number of accounts and the very limited amount of swipes per day. I have only logged into the app a few times and have already gone through every profile within a reasonable radius. You can expand this radius to +500 miles, but unless you are up for a long distance relationship, most people are going to be looking within 50 miles and even that\u2019s pushing it. The fact I went through every profile is even more surprising when you realize you are limited to 30 swipes a day. Not likes, swipes. As in you are allowed to look at up to 30 profiles a day before you are tapped out. I only recently managed to get one match and as of right now she has not responded. There is potential here, but as of right now it\u2019s mediocre at best.","Need more then 30 swipes. Or dont count the dislikes as a point. Also needs more people. You guys might wanna market..","Solid so far. Clean UI. Live in Tucson AZ so there's plenty of people. Broke dudes bitching about a $10 premium membership cant afford to take a girl on a date anyway. Its less than the cost of you gamepass or ps plus.","lesles","The Kippo dating app is great app in the app store, you must download it and see it....","Not bad. I like it so far. The UI quite beautiful.","Top tips make 30 swipes 50 and let people talk more then once it's not incentive to buy unlimited it's just gonna make people leave give better features worth buying and add a local section add a section where we can make gameing tournaments idk how hard it be but console and pc integration would be great so people can add friends directly to their system of choice also a guild/team system so people can find people who play on the same one obviously let people be in more then one group","With so many people on there I would hope for a match at least a cool gaming friend or something but I\u2019ve had this app for a few days now and haven\u2019t gotten a single match, it seems like others have the same issue too which I guess it\u2019s because it looks interesting to download but not appealing enough to keep for some? But I definitely agree that there should be some kind of changes made as to how matches can be more simple","So while I do agree with most people that the amount of swipes (and the fact of saying no counts) is kinda stupid, my main issue is there isn't really a filter for me to look at gay or bisexual men, it just puts any man on the app in, and I know this because I've come across a few friends(including my best friend) whom are straight men. Great concept! Just poorly executed.","It doesn\u2019t give me the code to enter after I put my phone number","30 swipe limit and no bio besides a limit of adding three cards. There's potential like others say but for now this app is hot garbage.","1 DM per day you have to be kidding","The concept is cool but it seems like people make profiles and then delete the app. This company has a major problem with customer acquisition and retention.","I assume its just cause its new, it has great ideas for cards I just wish you could get more than 3 slots and also wish you could customize them more. The defaults are pretty cringe. Like, the \u201carea 51 raid\u201d card is a good idea for showing off your favorite stuff, just the unfortunate thing is that it\u2019s all full of dead memes and even the raid itself is super dead. You\u2019d be better off not sticking to putting current memes into it cause millennials and gen z don\u2019t really take to it as much and it\u2019s because they\u2019re slow to implement. Just let the users insert whatever they want there and let them shake it up a little. That would be way better Also, I haven\u2019t gotten any matches yet despite I guess being a girl which this app also seems to lack some of. But I won\u2019t fault it to the app it\u2019s still clearly gaining user base you guys will get more users if you give more options, or maybe even implement mini games that you can play when you match to someone","i was really excited to download this app bc i\u2019d love to find a girl to play video games with, but even though i set my settings to female looking for female, the app only seems to show my profile to straight men. this app is very unwelcoming to anyone who isn\u2019t cis/het.","This app is garbage i wasted a full month so see none of the profiles are even real all it is is fake accounts with actuall online photos meaning robo accounts by this app developer i hope this app gets removed from google play soon","The app looks really cool but the swipe limit is pretty low and swiping \"no\" shouldn't count towards your limit. Also this app is a ghost town. I live in Houston literally one of biggest cities in the US and it took one day to swipe through everyone in my area.","Major issues with app optimization. Constant refreshes on my Oneplus 7t. This app should not refresh when I click the home button then go back to the app. I've missed out on liking two women because of that issues. I have a snapdragon 755+ 8 gigs of ram, and 128gb of UFS 3.0 storage. There's is no way this app should refresh every time whole its running in the background. Interesting concept. I have had two matches so far and will update the review at a later dayltw.","I\u2019ve been using this app for almost a month and I even bought premium in order to see more people but so far I\u2019ve yet to get a match. I\u2019m convinced that inactive users are still being shown, since I should\u2019ve gotten at least 1 message back by now but nothing. Now sure, it\u2019s reasonable to think that it\u2019s my fault but I just wish more people used this app and I wish there was an option to follow up on a message or see if it was read or not.","I really hate this stupid swipe stuff. It's so shallow and this app is meant to be about shared interests, not looks or hooking up. Also why do you need my location everytime I use the app? Not interested in talking to people near me at all. Also it crashes and goes offline a lot.","The app itself is absolutely gorgeous. Very clean and polished. But it needs to give you the option to not allow men to message. I put that I was only looking for women and the only person who messaged me was some thirsty guy and when I turned him down he started insulting me. Needless to say, I deleted the app and I'm not going to be using it again.","Not many people on this app and you only get 1 DM a day? Seems fairly greedy especially considering most apps have zero limit on intros.","You get 1 dm a day. What the actua f u c k I n g waste of time .","ABSOLUTELY DO NOT DOWNLOAD. Unless you like the idea of paying $$$ to look at fake profiles. Apparently if you want an actual dating experience you have to pay for a membership because no one talks and no one seems real. At least on the \"basic\" apps, people/bots message or talk to you. Every profile I looked at seemed like they were against getting dm'd or just wasn't a real person.","It's great!","The app looks cool but unfortunately i can't sign up due to my phone being off. If there was an option to sign up with email, it'd be real helpful.","Unique and cool idea but horribly flawed. A friend of mine who's a gamer and streamer suggested the app. While its a cool idea, i just feel like I dont get enough information on the profiles of people. I also feel uncomfortable as a streamer to have an app pin point my exact location when it affects my safety from potential creeps. You should be given the option to turn it off if you're just finding people to game with or in general potential dates.","Pretty fun- I just wish I could filter who sees my profile. I'm a lesbian looking for women, and would like it if men couldn't see my profile. Becides that I love it.","I'd give 0 stars if I could. You only get to look at like 10 profiles or less, the details on the profiles are cool, its a neat concept but like 5-10 profiles a day?? Gtfoh","Sucked","Alright so the only thing going for this app is the UI, absolutely zero matches which has never happened to me before on any other app, are these profiles even real? Has anyone actually talked to someone?","I think a nice addition would be to see who said yes to you instead of finding out after you both say yes","Great starting point but it could use more features. Dating based on games, age, and distance is a good start but I still feel like it should have the basic elements in profiles and searches as well such as height, body type, education level, etc. Your basics from other dating sites melded with this concept to create a better search/interaction results. Probably wouldn\u2019t use it again until it had these components.","Literally can't sign in to this app. I type my phone number in and can't hit continue. I'm just trying to find my minecraft girlfriend and Kippo is ruining my chances.","Pretty sure no one uses this app. Also thorougly convinced that half the profiles arent even real.","I have had the app now for about a week, I enjoy the cards and the overall design of the app feels great. However I have some concerns. First the amount of swipes a day is a bit small. Second for over a week now I have liked most of the people in my area (I live in a big city in NC) and I have yet to find one match? It\u2019s a bit strange? Compared to competitors such as tinder I find extremely more matches. This app is great for gamers to connect to other gamers but I have yet to see any result from it. I\u2019ll give it about a month of swiping but if I don\u2019t see a match by then, then either they may be a big with the app or it\u2019s just not for me.","Best U.I, but not for a dating app. Going on this app doesn't feel like you're going on there to meet a potential soul mate, it makes you feel like you're only going on there to make friends.","Amazing app! Easy to tell who is a gamer and who is a reject of other apps. Everyone is complaining about what you get for free. Just subscribe! New apps need funding to survive and improve and there are no ads. If you can't talk to people with the info provided, this app won't work for you. There is literally a \"what video games do you like\" section... People here expecting a miracle product lol. You have to put the time in like all things.","bruh this doesnt even have osu as an option smh","trigger warning for mentions of suicide and abuse// back in may i was recovering from a serious breakup from an emotionally abusive relationship and losing my job of 2 1/2 years and started a new one. i was 8 months out of highschool, didn\u2019t get accepted to college, and had basically no friends except for 2 who had their own things going on, so i rarely talked to them about my own problems after enough months of making them deal with my breakup and job loss+regain. i felt so alone by this point i was locked up in my room doing nothing but painting or playing animal crossing every day, smoking weed, and contemplating suicide. i came so close too. then one day i got curious cause i\u2019d never actually tried a dating app before, but i found this one in the app store while searching for ones to download. to be totally honest i was looking for sugar dating apps to make money instead, but then i noticed kippo and it said for gamers. i was hesitant because my ex was a gamer, and like i said, he was really emotionally abusive. he was also a raging alcoholic so that was a major no no. but upon downloading kippo, i saw how different it was from all the other apps, and that it showed things i actually cared about with people. the first week was completely dead, i wasn\u2019t getting anyone worth swiping on, but i wasn\u2019t expecting to so i just kept going. then one night things got really bad for me, and i began making suicide notes and videos for my friends and family. i had only made one 45 minute video and note for one of my friends before i was interrupted by a message from the app. it was the second time anyone actually sent me a chat, and he was more interesting than the first guy. to be honest i wasn\u2019t a fan of the chat system so i asked him to add me on snapchat, and then we kept talking from there before i quickly gave him my phone number. the next night i got home from the new job i was working and asked him to play animal crossing together, and he said yes. it was an instant connection once we started speaking in the discord call as i visited his island, and that same night i asked to fall asleep to him on call, cause i was needy, and he said yes. not a day has gone by since then that we haven\u2019t facetimed or texted or called in discord, and i wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything. when i finally got the strength to leave my ex, i swore the only time i\u2019d ever fall in love with a man again was if he was the complete opposite, and loved me the way i deserved so i could love him back just as much and not feel taken advantage of for it, and my noah is exactly that. i have kippo to thank for introducing me to a literal angel. thank you. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f","I cant say much about this all because I cant even make a profile. It doesnt send a code to my phone at all. So I dont even make it out of the main screen. 0/10","The app is pretty cool! Won't give 5 stars due to the amount of swipes you're given, 30 isn't enough.","Wow 1 whole message a day thats stupid","Great app. Don't like the swiping limit, but the premium is inexpensive compared to other apps. Give it a try if you're a nerd/gamer!","Has potential. The look is really unique, and the UI is one of the coolest I've seen. But like the app itself, you are forced to pick people on an aesthetic level which is difficult for making good matches. It defeats the purpose of an app like this. Needs more information for profiles besides the bio card. Forced use of location to use the app is annoying if you have a data limit. 30 person limit is too few and clearly a money grab. I wouldn't invest money in an app the offers so little.","The app so far seems fine but there are just a few kinks that can be resolved in an update. 1) The daily limit is a little bit too limiting. Instead of having 30 swipes for all activity it should be adjusted to 45 - 50 swipes for likes only. Losing the ability to like someone because you disliked other people is a big turn off. 2) For the cards, there should be an option for up to at least 5 or 6 so there's more for people to work with. 3) An increase in cards to include more games and types.","Really nice and simple UI. The app has potential but I wish like most the other reviewers, the 30/day limit wasn't on all swipes, but just likes. Also Senna, my main champion in League, isn't available on the card for LoL. Would be nice to add more cards to your profile, not having to use a card for a bio, or a social links card for IG, Snapchat or Discord","Having the ability to set your location would be nice if you move around for work (keep home location). Especially if you pay for it...","No Bio ! What is a dating app without bios, how are going to Express ur personality . Please add a bio","If I put that I am a male and put looking for males. They just show every male, straight males. There\u2019s no lgbt option here","The app is appealing from a visual standpoint but not being able to write a bio and the swiping limit are a little unnecessary as well as the inability to see who is online or who the most active users are, subscription costs are way too high especially during these hard times of a pandemic..I hope the developers make improvements because Kippo has a lot of potential that could change the online dating scene. Edit: It's very glitchy to where it force closed on me when I tried messaging someone.","I think the app has potential and there isn't much to really improve in my opinion. I think if you swipe no on someone that shouldn't count for your 30 likes a day limit, which I think should be increased, still 30 likes is pretty small. I also believe that the dming system should be more like the intro system from okcupid where you can send a set amount of them per day. I think the app is good overall though","Visually gorgeous, the cards are well done. App is lacking two needed features, they have a dm feature that should be augmented or replaced with an intro, like OkCupid to be less intrusive to the other user. It also could use a self summary option without consuming a card. Monetization model is greedy, left swipes shouldn't consume uses. Overall, lot of promise.","This app is alright so far, haven't used it much. Needs a bug fix for the bio. I put in the bio card and it saved the first draft. Now I can't change it or delete it and make a new one because I can exit the app and my old one/first draft is still the one showing.","Requires you to make an account via phone number with a text code and I never got the text. Shame... I really wanted to try this app.","This app has a lot of potential, awesome interface and profile system. Only thing that gets me is the limited number of potential matches a day: 30","Great app. Super intuitive and unique. Matched with someone who makes me really happy \ud83e\udd70 I can\u2019t wait to spend the rest of my days with her \u2764\ufe0f","Cant even finish setting up account","Great app! But it takes FOREVER TO LOAD","The best spyware tools is JEREMYhackLORD@ GMAIL,COM he tracked down spouse phones remotely  within few hours  of contacting him, he is really legit","App lets you select an age range for what you see, and preferred gender (between male/female/all) but that preference does not seem to control who can see you, and there's no place to share your orientation on your profile in the app that I can find. Very visually pleasing aesthetic but not very useful as a dating app until that is implemented.","Couldn't even sign up. Kept getting error code 39.","Love the idea and I do find the concept a lot more interesting then other online dating apps. I feel like it's a lot easier to get a feel for people but also (as someone who is terrible with bios) it makes easier to create a bio without having to think too hard. This app could really be a great place for gamers to meet but also for non gamers. I believe that there should be more dating apps with this type of format. I dont like 30 swipes a day I think it should be higher at like 50.","The app seems cool so far. My only concern is that my preference is women but my card is visible to men and I am getting messages from them.","Everything seems pretty cool. Until you realize there's a 30 limit on how many profiles you can see per day. Absolutely ridiculous","I love the app but I couldn't get a single match. Damn, I must be super ugly. Great UI though.","While the idea of the app is excellent in concept (I had fun just filling out my profile and viewing other people\u2019s for a few weeks), I\u2019ve never had a single match. Just about every single day for at least a month, I\u2019ve exhausted my available likes and sent my one free message to a girl I thought was cute and I\u2019ve gotten nothing back. Not even a like by *anyone*. I\u2019m not a male model, granted, but I put effort into my profile and my messages. To not even get a single like implies to me that this app has an intense gender imbalance and the girls that do try it out are swamped with likes and messages. Distance doesn\u2019t really matter, either: for the first few weeks I was content to set it at the maximum distance, but got nothing. When I lowered to my immediate area and swiped through my potential matches, I also got nothing. I feel like if I even had a single like or match to show me that I *exist* on this app, I\u2019d be more inclined to use it. As it stands now, though, I consistently forget that I even own it because nothing ever comes of it.","I've been waiting for app like this I like it so far but I'm already having a problem when I try to send a direct message it backs me out of the app completely.","Premium is priced way to high. I wish you could view an unlimited amount of potential matches a day in the free version. There should atleast be a free trail for premium. Or just fill the app with ads and make the premium features free lol. It's kinda weird how you can't write anything about yourself either.","I need a way to get people my own age. Or, unlimited swipe? Because I'm not wanting to match with teenagers when I'm in my mid 20s. Creepy in my opinion.","Profile building is fun at first, but very limited. You only get 3 little cards and a list of 9 favorite games. No description or anything, 4 pictures total. Like every dating app, it locks basic social media functions behind a pay wall. 1 message a day, 10 profiles a day? and let's you add more cards, which are few and bare boned. Normally I rate dating apps 1 star for the gross paywall alone.. but its a mildly fun concept and it let me choose non-binary for my gender so ill be generous.","For a dating app, it's missing the essentials. The cards are useless and don't tell you anything about the person or what they're on the app for. This app is more reliant on you liking someone's profile for their looks than any other dating app because that's literally the only thing you really have to go on. No about me, no desired relationship type, no nothing.","I love everything about this app except how restricted the free version is. Although the premium version is a bit cheaper than other dating apps, so it's worth sticking around to see if I need it. That being said, I love the interface and I definitely find myself liking more people than usual. I just have to pray they like me back because once you hit \"like\", they disappear and you have no way of contacting them.","Not great if you're gay/lesbian. I shouldn't have been able to receive messages from men as a lesbian not looking for friendship. Would be better if you could include just a short blurb about yourself, and if you could tailor your experience more if you're LGBT.","Don\u2019t believe all the lies... once you make an account the next day it\u2019ll get deleted.","App seems really cool and streamline so far, but I can't edit cards that require you to scroll to input the info :[ the scroller doesn't move so i can't put the cards I want on my profile since I have to complete them first.","I dont have a phone number is there away i can use any of my socal medies.","App keep crashes and closes when trying to direct message","Can't even add a description? Why?","Solid start. I think the lack of users does kind of limit the app, but that should improve as it grows. One thing I feel like its lacking is the option to have a small bio. Being able to say something about yourself beyond the provided cards could go a long way.","Would be much better if your 30 likes are only used when you like someone. Also no way to change birthdays, had to send an email to change it but they are very quick. Still more fun than other dating apps.","Its a funny app but seriously no users... yet they are coming for sure \ud83d\udc4d","No one, as far as I can tell, uses this app. It is a dead platform and all the five star comments are fake. Have been using this app for the past 2 weeks and haven\u2019t gotten a single person in my area... I even set it to 500 miles and still one one after that first day. I would just recommend Tinder and be open, I\u2019ve already gotten a few matches and I was open and honest. The app is a good concept, but no one is active on here and I even spent money to boost myself. Not worth the download or space on my phone.","While very promising the app definitely needs more users which will come! That's not why it's four stars though. I think the matching system is kind of odd and I'm unsure if 30 a day is the right amount. Maybe likes a day? I do think quality over quantity is important in this app though and patience is a huge part! The biggest gripe is lack of value for the premium right now. More cards doesn't seem like good value and unlimited first messaging doesn't either.","They spend more money on sponsorships then app developing","This is an awesome app that needs more attention","I\u2019ve had the app for awhile now-months at least. And nothing at all. No responses, no matches, no activity whatsoever. It also recycled and uses the same profiles over and over again. I\u2019ve had better luck on tinder of all places which begs the question, in a place with so many similar people of similar interests, why is this app so dead?","Decided to try the app again, and it seems to be working fine again, so far the app is had great features.","this app is nice so far, i like it! i really appreciate that there is a non-binary option! it would be great if non-binary was also an an option in discovery so i can see other non-binary people without having to see everyone. maybe the profiles should say your gender on it as well? you can't always tell gender just by looks. also another suggestion is that you get to see more people every 12 hours instead of the next day. good work!! i look forward to what you guys do next with this app!!\u2764\ufe0f","Been waiting a while for this, and it delivers in terms of being a dating app for gamers. The problem is it's not made clear you only get 1 message a day on the free version (seems so little). You also only get 30 likes/dislikes a day in the free version. Edit: on second thought the 30 is honestly a lot better after a bit, makes each result feel more personal, so I'll up a star. Still eh about the one message a day, but once you match the between messages are unlimited","I've been using this for a few days and am a premium user. I'll start with what I like: Dark mode is excellent; the gamer-centric cards are fun, interactive, and unique; the overall design is very clean; small details (chat color tweaks and flairs) are nice additions. It's missing many key dating app features: filters for looking for (and others); any kind of bio/leading answers from which to spark meaningful conversation; game titles to select; and viewing who's liked you.","I think this app is very well made. Having the option to add a brief profile description would be nice so we can introduce ourselves a bit more. I would also like to option to filter gamers by the games they play, keywords (will require adding a keyword/tag system), etc.","No-one uses this app. You'll be stuck with no new users after 3 days.","This app is so great. I think it truly was built for gamers. They have neat little cards to help show your favourite games. The matching is really good too. You actually can see up to 30 singles a day meaning you can send 30 likes. If someone matches with, it costs no money to see them or to talk to them. Theirs is no payment wall. Now if you want to extend past 30 likes a day to infinity you pay a monthly fee. Plus props to the developer for requiring 4 photos and to how you view them. 10/10 :)","Really like this idea, but its missing some basics that other dating apps have, Like a filter for searching. Really would like to filter by games played. TV shows, books and movies need to be add in my opinion, and the ability to filter my them. And of course the ability to filter things like smoking, kids/no kids and the basics like that. Theres no bio, whitch I think is a plus but could turn some people off. Over all its a good start. But needs stuff added.","No matter what I do the app keeps crashing whenever it tries to log into my account","its ok so far! i was so excited to have this android version so i could check my account more and all, i know its only just come out but im super disappointed the card options doesnt include the bio/poem/prompt one? im not sure why this is, but i hope that changes bc thats the one i rely on most","Been waiting for this to drop for a while. Some of the best UI work, polish, and intuitive design I've ever seen on any dating app. Period. Bar none. Missing personalized text prompt though. This is a basic addition to dating apps, so the exclusion seems out of place.","Well, the UI and UX is nice, but I can't seem to get past the location setup even after turning on and off the location. I'll edit my review once the bug has been addressed.","This is the best app for gamers to connect and play together with new people hands down. It's finally out for android!","No matches, convos, or anything from this app. A great idea, a dating app for gamers, but sadly no one\u2019s heard of it nor does anyone use it.","I love how there is a first impression message I can send! I paid for one month and only wish I could filter out the Only Friends people.","I\u2019ve liked at least 100+ profiles so you don\u2019t have to. This app doesn\u2019t work at the time of this post.

And several friends found spouses/fianc\u00e9s. Highly recommended!","I downloaded this app with much skepticism. I set up my profile (very easily) and started matching. The interface is so simple and very easy to use. The little cards they have available to make your profile is so much different from traditional online dating apps. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but I\u2019m having so much fun using this!","this app is really cute and unique and honestly, if it wasn't for the small user base it would be my favorite app to meet new people! i hope more people find out about it, it's a really cool idea!","First off, please go take a look at all the 5 star reviews. They all have similar generic titles and comment how \u201cwonderful\u201d of an dating app this is (and are also all ironically mass posted on the same block of days). Here\u2019s why I believe these reviews are fake: The concept of the app is interesting, but the execution is lackluster at best. You are limited to 30 swipes per day, which includes likes and dislikes. That is asinine - no other dating app is this restrictive. Furthermore, actually matching with people is seemly impossible. I have been on this app for over 1 month now and have not received a single match. Each day I swiped on 30 people meaning after sifting through 1000 people I couldn\u2019t find a single match. I even started swiping on people that I was not even remotely attracted to and still nothing. There is not a single dating app out there that I have had this experience with. Please do not waste your time with this app. If you are eager to find someone to date that plays video games, your are exponentially more likely to meet them in whatever game you like than this joke of a platform.","It says 17 and up but not working for 17 year olds","Met more people in three days than Instagram, Snapchat and hangouts combined! Good job guys!","First of all if you're a brand new dating app I would suggest that you wouldn't immediately start being money-hungry and make the entire purpose of your app to be paid for. Second, you only get 30 swipes every 24 hours when you\u2019re using it for free and that's ridiculous. No one wants to wait that long and no one wants to pay to find someone to play videogames/love, whatever. You rarely get a match and that's because your app isn't popular and the reason why it's not is because you pull your users in and then decide to charge us for a subscription that's not worth it. I would suggest get your marketing staff together and reconfigure your priorities. As a gamer this is basically the EA of dating apps because you sure are making this app unplayable if I don't buy the DLC. I'm Alt+Control+Deleting myself out of this app. Haha get it? But seriously I won't come back until you give people more swipes. I could find more gamers on Tinder or Bumble than your sorry excuse of a sub par dating app.","So my thing, right off the bat. You can\u2019t search by GAME! I want to search for people who specifically play MTG, and yet the function isn\u2019t there. Huge missed opportunity. Also, you can\u2019t write a bio...people should be able to say LFG, romance, whatever. I think this is a dating app that should LEAN IN to the gaming community. Please add the function to search by game.","Needs more features like seeing who likes you fro example. Makes matches easier.","It's a very good app.. Im bein honest. It actually helps when I don't have a lot to snapchat friends. Thanks to this app","Amazing. Gain so many friends of which some are very nice. You might have to block some but overall a good app","Great app! Met a lot of great people here. Easy to use and actually has real people on the site!","I like the video chat feature, It is awesome to chat with new people then when you're ready to see them face to face you don't have to download another app.","Great app...Its prefect for getting more followers on your social media and for boosting your snapchat score by having people do streaks with you.","Its a very nice app, so that you can get to meet new people your age but the only thing is that the coins are to expensive!","Its a great app to use if you are just starting up on social media and need friends / views to get you started","They dont bot or ask for money to BuY fOlLoWeRs. You should install it its great. My snap score is getting higher daily Snap","Used the free version added a lot of cool peoplle on snap. Took far less time to get 30 mew people than asking people i know and im just trying to pass time snap!","If you have the subscription to this app it's fantastic and you can meet a lot of new people. Unfortunately without the subscription it's kinda hard to find people. Otherwise, there are actually a lot of really good looking people on this app and my Snapchat has blown up since I've gotten it.","Its good, I have a hard time social interacting and making friends, and being able to just open and app and meet a new person is great.","It's a pretty good app, it is easy to make new friends on snap and insta. Needs some small improvement but def recommend!","This is an amazing app u can video chat off of and also even get more followers on Snap Chat in a very good in useful app but add just a little bit more features in it will be even cooler\u270c\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc99","pretty good app, good for finding friends or finding something else if you catch my drift ;) but over all the app has good overlay and is easy to use would recommend","Yo it's good but when u copy their user name down where does it go wats supposed to happen how do I find out wat it's called","This is the app which I was looking for.. A genuine and authentic one.. Seriously I got so many user IDs on this which helped me to connect..","It's a 5 star app but I only see one picture per person, can't the developer add an album or something.","Wow so great my life doesn't seem to be played with it's normal to post on another social website. Its a good friend app for Instagram and Snapchat","Hey am proud of this application it's nice I like it. Let's appreciate it's easy and fast way of meeting your soulmate","Great for discovering a new type of people looking for a solid relationship by starting online. The monthly fee is a hit expensive but other than that all is great.","It would be better if you could message people","I\u2019ve had this app for a couple days and I haven\u2019t seen one notification. I have non stop been swiping on different people and messaged at least two. But I haven\u2019t gotten a single notification from this app and when I check everything is empty how do I know if anyone swiped on me or if people swiped back again on me.","i\u2019ve downloaded and used MANY apps trying to connect and meet new people, and i\u2019ve had no where near the amount of success as i\u2019ve had on this app. if you\u2019re a gamer looking to connect, or looking for something a little bit more (like a relationship), then kippo is definitely the app for you. from the cards (prompts) you can attach to you profile, to the people you\u2019ll find across the world, this app definitely will have something for you, and i\u2019m sure you\u2019re bound to find someone to connect with!","How am I supposed to match if I can\u2019t message anyone. The app is so glitchy all I can do is send likes. Very innovative on the end though","Tried throwing myself into Tinder but it didn\u2019t work. I feel like I\u2019m connecting with more people here. Only complaint is that there are a ton of people looking for friends when the tagline is \u201cThe Dating App for Gamers\u201d. But it\u2019s not like that\u2019s Kippo\u2019s fault.","I saw an add showing Kippo and instantly was interested in trying it to see if I can either find a person to date or just find a friend to game with. I have not matched with one person and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because they\u2019re not interested in me or if the app does not work. I really wish it did because the idea of having a network of gamers connecting with one another is a great idea.","The user interface is very clever and actually an interesting way to see if you and another person have any mutual interests. However, I\u2019ve had no matches on the app after 2 weeks of use. Even after swiping right on all users, I was still left with no matches.","95% of the people who like me tell me to follow their twitch or YouTube channel and never reply back.","Expect 0 matches 0 message 100 ethot promoting on bs thanks for wasting my time crap app 0 zeros stars","I truly enjoy this app. I know it\u2019s supposed to be a \u201cdating\u201d app but I\u2019ve been making more friends than anything. I forget that it\u2019s supposed to be a dating honestly. Good app to meet gamers who play similar games and personalities.","I was loving the app, but there\u2019s a bug right now and I can\u2019t see any of my matches or messages anymore nor can\u2019t I send anything. I almost want to uninstall until it\u2019s fixed. I was having a nice conversation with someone and I can\u2019t even communicate to them what happened. I\u2019m sad because I feel like I might lose the match if it\u2019s not fixed soon.","I think you should be able to filter your profile to be looking for friends specifically or looking for love specifically. This makes it more LGBTQ friendly but can also work for opposite gender friendships","Very unique and fun at first, but too slow due to the limitation of only VIEWING 30 profiles a day. User base is very small. I do not intend to use this app further.","In this new patch, for some reason it deleted the previous chat convo that I was talking to. Like it was totally erased from the tab","Really neat app, fun features and easy to work with. Had an issue with chats recently disappearing but it looks like they\u2019re currently working on the issue and plan to have it fixed soon. 5/5 so far!","The app forced an update on me, and afterwards when it finished, all my matches and conversations were deleted. It\u2019s really BS","Considering the low user base already... it\u2019s hard to find matches and then they delete all the matches while forcing an update","The new updates somehow deleted all my messages and won\u2019t allow me to match with anyone anymore","After I updated the app, all my messages and matches disappeared. Please fix this.","August 2nd I updated the app and next thing you know... all my on going conversations just poof gone. :( wth. But we talk on discord still lol still had 28 days left for the chat as well.","The idea of matching gamers is amazing, but with this app you\u2019ll be direct messaging the person to basically match with them. You\u2019re given a certain amount of profile views a day which is their way of saying take the time to look over the persons profile. I give this a 1 star because my direct messaging messages were all deleted and that\u2019s the only way to talk/interact with the person. That\u2019s totally unacceptable to me.","The app was cool at first but once I got a match(most importantly near me, since most people are not near me) and we started to talk there was an update. Once the updated was done, I lost the match and messages... so what was the point...","It\u2019s an alright app, definitely can say most chicks on here are just trying to gain followers instead of getting to know you. New update made me lose all the matches and conversations I had, thanks guys!","So I recently joined this app to see what is out there. I didn\u2019t think it would be much to be honest. I it interesting and unique in its own right. I man not totally be on board with the number of swipes per day but I understand why. So I got a few matches and started a few conversations. Then, came the update. The recent update deleted all my matches and conversations. They may need to re-evaluate their updates and how the roll out will end up affecting users. I do not really write reviews but this really got under my skin.","I was anxious to set up my profile, I made it to the photo step and was stuck saving for 45 minutes. Might be deleting this since I can\u2019t even use it.","I really like it. It\u2019s got a ton of potential. It just needs more users and maybe more than one free message per day. I would recommend giving out 2 weeks of free membership after a user first signs up.","And they just want your money. Why would you only be able to see 30 people a day? Why is there no short bio? Why only 4 pictures?","Its a really cool app i love the layouts and profile customization but im not sure if its a glitch or im just repulsive because i have not had a single match.","Wanted me to upload 4 pictures of myself and it has to be me in the picture. I do not want to do this. Tinder does not require this. I uploaded one picture I would have even uploaded one more but I don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing my face until I feel comfortable on the app. I will uninstall and just talk to people on my PS4 headset. Company\u2019s want too much of your information these days and it is weird.","I would\u2019ve used the app","Hello Kippo staff team. I was recommended this app by a couple friends just to check it out however i was unable to even get past the verification code part. I want to try out your app and see what the talk is about. If theres any way youre able to help with this thatd would be greatly appreciated","Overall, I like the concept of this app and the execution is not bad. My biggest gripe after a day of using this app is that you have to pay to send direct messages in the matching process after the first few times you do it. I understand that this is a newer app and that revenue has to come in somehow, but Hinge does direct messaging for no additional cost to the customer. I would rather there be stricter daily limits for matching without payment, in exchange for limitless direct messaging. Overall great concept for an app regardless, but I may not keep using this app if this isn\u2019t changed.","I think the app is fine and all but you should add features like have a place to see who gave you a heart and fix the DMs because if I say something to someone I want to see what and who I sent the message to even if they don\u2019t respond and add more cards it gets old looking at the same one\u2019s everyday.","I gave this 4 stars not because I got an overwhelming amount of matches or anything. I just love the fact that someone came up with an easy to use dating app for gamers. With that being said, I only have one problem with this app: when you purchase an \u201cinfinity\u201d membership, you\u2019re not able to see who likes you. I am someone who doesn\u2019t have all day. If that feature could be added, I\u2019d give this a full 5 stars.","Honestly the idea is AMAZING. First app I\u2019ve ever downloaded from and ad in my life. But there\u2019s some strange limitations. You can only have 4 pictures and no more. The biggest issue is that you only get 15 to 20 swipes PER DAY. And yes, swipes. Not matches, not swipe rights. If you don\u2019t like anyone that day and swipe left all 20 or so times you\u2019re done. I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s to keep people coming back since the app is new and they don\u2019t want you to blow through everyone in your area in one day (due to being new) but yikes. My suggestions would be first and foremost GREATLY extend the limit of swipes. Another idea would be to have a visible checklist of what consoles/systems you have. Include PC, consoles, VR, everything. Also maybe have a specific image slot for your gaming set up to show off your space. If things change for the better I will update my review but as it stands, being done swiping for the entire day in about 3 minutes is very discouraging.","This women I talk to is blackmailing me if I don\u2019t send $100 to her because she trick me to send nudes to her, I\u2019ve obviously block her and I\u2019m worrying the hell out because she\u2019ll send it to other journalist and news reporter in my state. This app was is ABSURD!! SCREW THIS APP AND THE DEVELOPER !!","The app itself is great and easy to use, really the best one out of all of the gamer apps with the best user interface too. I only have two issues with it: If I'm limited to 30 matches a day (thats fair they have to make money somehow), I wish it would show me people who play the same video games as me to match with. Secondly, theres a terrible bug that makes it so that you cant log into the app sometimes and I have no idea how to fix it. (It will prompt you to make a new account with the same phone number as before, really strange) If they could fix the bug that makes their app unusable i would change my review to 5 stars ^_^","I\u2019m looking to make friends that play games but there isn\u2019t really an option to let people know your married! I\u2019m sad because I really want to use this app but it\u2019s not really meant for people in a relationship. PLEASE MAKE AN OPTION TO ADD A RELATIONSHIP STATUS!","I found a girl who I love more than anyone else in the world here. It worked for me so it could work for you too.","Found the love of my life!","Yeah the infinity option isn't working","I am a lesbian and I don\u2019t want to talk to straight girls, also I don\u2019t want to be seen by men! They are all very creepy and I may uninstall if they keep asking to match","Idk what\u2019s going on but when i use other apps for dating and gamers I get messages but I\u2019ve been using this app all day and no messages, no matches or anything . Idk if the app is messed up or maybe I\u2019m having connectivity issues but I\u2019ve seen other people complain about this too. I think it has to do with some people not being shown and so there are no matches for us. Other than that it\u2019s pretty cool. I also wish that you cool pick what you\u2019re looking for. Example: friendship, relationship, just to chat etc.","I happily paid for the membership fee as I cannot stand all the other dating apps out there and want to support people making better options (especially for gamers). My main gripe is that the search radius is either 0-99 or the whole planet. It would be rad if there were more variables (200, 500 miles etc) and also maybe a game search. For example if I wanted to find a gal who also plays FFXIV. Anyways, really good job so far! Please please do not go to some algorithm based junk like other apps. It\u2019s so much harder to meet people than it was before when algorithms didn\u2019t rule the dating site world.","App is cool but no matter how many times I try to purchase a subscription it just hangs on a loading screen.","I met my boyfriend on here! Now I have someone to share memes with an beat at Mario party \ud83d\udc96","The app is nice but I get no matches. Maybe I\u2019m just too ugly :\u2019(.","Been using Kippo for a few days. I find the limit for non infinity users to be quite small, especially when getting repeats. I would absolutely love to find a more expanded preferences filter (i.e. ethnicity) and I think having a short bio text box rather than using the poem calling card would be very ideal.","After being burned out on all the dating apps with shady practices owned by Matchgroup, this app is seriously refreshing. You can connect with people based on gaming lifestyles and the Card system is a fantastic way to express yourself even if you\u2019re not a big fan of filling out profiles. The algorithm is extremely honest and transparent, plus it doesn\u2019t try to decide what you want for you. It will tell you if there are people in your area and it won\u2019t get funky with showing you matches outside of what you search for. I\u2019m just an average guy who likes to strike up normal, casual conversation as an opener and there\u2019s this membrane I often can\u2019t punch through on usual \u201cindustry\u201d dating apps. On Kippo, I\u2019m actually getting conversations from matches and that\u2019s after only having signed up for a few days! Not to mention, their premium service was only $10/month, or less if I were to get the multi-month subscription?? Goodbye OkCupid and your ridiculous $50/Month A-List. You can play an MMO for $15/month, so Kippo\u2019s pricing actually respects my time and my money. Keep up the great work!! I\u2019m going to stay subscribed to premium and see how Kippo expands and evolves over time. I definitely want more card variety, and it would be great if I could list more games as favorites or as a \u201chere\u2019s what I\u2019ll play with you\u201d list. Other than that, expanding the user base is the only urgent thing I\u2019d like to see.","I downloaded the app thought it seemed pretty cool, but you have to pay for a membership.... they claim you can use it for free but you don\u2019t get any functions hardy at all and it continually asks you to pay for the membership I even confronted their social media team about it and they deleted my comment after bringing it up. I have screen shots to prove everything I\u2019m saying is the truth. This app is just a cash grab and I wouldn\u2019t trust it having any of my data","this app has such a low amount of users i get people that are thousands of miles away from me. it also doesn\u2019t have any remotely attractive people on here. it should be called \u201cthe dating app for greasy neck-bearded guys and ugly fat girls\u201d","Every time I typed in my phone number. It seems to be refusing to send me a codes to sign in. I hate that. Fix this please.","The app works alright, and has acceptable functionality. They put you on worldwide search by default, since you\u2019ll probably only see 10-20 profiles a day your first week, then one or two a day if you search locally.","So while I really like the niche aspect of this app, it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019ve encountered the same people over and over again. It\u2019s one thing if someone passed on me in the past and I show up again to them to give them another chance, but if I like someone once, they shouldn\u2019t show up in my queue again. This wouldn\u2019t be quite so bad, if not for the fact that you\u2019re limited on how many profiles you can view a day, meaning you often get clogged down with repeat profiles. I get it if I live in an area with not that many users, but I\u2019m in the SF bay, which is THE nerd hot spot of America. I should be fine. I\u2019d rather have no one available than see the same people over and over again. L","I had a lot of hope for this app, I reaaaallly wanted it to be good but it was kind of a let down; I even paid for the premium for a month. I wish you could be able to see the people who like you first if you buy the premium. I also wish there was an option to write a short bio or something. I know the app is suppose to stand out and be different, but sometimes having the basic functionalities included with the other good dating apps should be a given. Kinda wish I could have gotten a refund for that month I paid. :/ I hope it improves in the future","I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of screen scaling issues or what, but I can\u2019t fill out/complete a lot of things. Because my keyboard remains up while trying to fill in favorite games, I can\u2019t see the last few options when searching (I could puuuuull the list up just enough to *see* the game I wanted, but couldn\u2019t select it) Same problem with some of the cards. I couldn\u2019t adjust the last slider on the personality type card, and I couldn\u2019t complete the Harry Potter card because I couldn\u2019t select anything for the Patronus (I assume that\u2019s what\u2019s down there in the place-that-cannot-be-seen) It is a fun concept but I can\u2019t even properly build my profile \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f","I\u2019ve made so many friends on here, but I feel like this app should also allow teens or have a separate app for teen gamers!","Unable to sign up bc the code is not being sent to my number","I can\u2019t even make an account to try it out because the phone verification is bugged and won\u2019t send me a code. There should be more than one way to create an account. Idk maybe through email","I love the app. For a gamer like myself, it\u2019s the best one and easiest to connect with people.","Kippo sounds like a really cool way to make friends and I wanted to make friends on there so I can finally have someone to actually play with instead of doing solo games but I decided not to keep it because I personally think it collects too much personal information like for example, they want real life photos of you. Some people don\u2019t want to show their faces online.","I just downloaded this app and I had an issue where it froze and I swiped left on some people on accident so I hope they fix it. Other than that I like the concept of the app","I love the UI and the concept of this app! It\u2019s so simple but still gives you an idea of who the person is with little reading involved. The app itself is responsive and quick. The app just works! The most unique dating app on the App Store right now? However, I rated it 4 stars because although this app is great, I pretty much never get any matches and when I do, they seem to say 1 thing to me and never respond again. I\u2019m not sure if my profile/app is bugged or if they were bots perhaps. I considered getting premium but I don\u2019t want to risk it if I\u2019m already having issues. I still love the app despite these issues, I just wish it worked for me.","I love the format and general idea behind this. I haven\u2019t really seen anything else that tries to put gamers/nerds together. The amount of profiles you can look at per day feels a little frustrating and limited, but considering the possibility of matching with someone of guaranteed mutual interest; it seems worth sticking with for a bit.","No verification for the format of phone#. Unable to receive the verification message, no error message got shown, no hints for what I can do. I desperately entered random verify code, then it just stuck here. At least I should know what\u2019s going on right here. Anyways, still got a fancy ui experience, hope u guys can fix those bugs soon","It\u2019s fine","Requires cell number can\u2019t even try it till my cell service is back.","Not one worth a right swipe. Tough.. guess back to tinder","Downloaded the app because I seen AngelsKimi backed it. I love everything about it, just not popular enough yet.","Great app for connecting with people! Concept is good and also met few people through this app. Just a suggestion that kindly add more features in the app.","I paid for the infinite swipes and I\u2019ve had this app a few weeks and I still don\u2019t have a single match. This thing is designed to absorb your money based on false hope.","Love this social networking site, so easy to use.. Friendly and loving the fact we dnt have to add friends to talk to ppl all over the world. Would be good if we could tag a person but that's all good.","It lets you see like 15 profiles per day unless you pay. Thought it was gonna be super cool but I wasted a lot of time before I found the settings that were half decent","I know this app is fairly new, I\u2019m hopeful there will be an update that allows you to put more creative cards when it comes to building your deck, not just 3.","I can't get past the sign up page personally. Waiting for a text code to come to my phone but it never came through","Interface for the app is completely different. It really needs minor tweaks to be a better app. Should definitely add filters for ppl you would like to see or match with. Really the worst part and my main dislike is the amount of \u201cswiping\u201d that can be done per day. Left and right swipes count towards your daily \u201cswipes\u201d once this specifically is fixed I\u2019m sure the app will bloom.","I was pretty surprised by the app. Although theres not a huge amount of people on this app there\u2019s enough and the people aren\u2019t as bad as what I expected. I expected a lot of incels but I haven\u2019t seen any yet! Also the layout and the cards you can add are super cool! I can tell they put a lot of effort into this app! Only complaint is I wish you could add a bio and free swipes lasted longer, but premium isn\u2019t very expensive (10 dollars a month, while apps like bumble are 25.)","Doesn\u2019t really seem like anyone really uses the app. My friends and I downloaded it to see who can find someone first and not one match for any one. If it was just 2 out of five that didn\u2019t get a match I understand but all 5 of us? That kinda seems weird.","That feel when no one within 100+ mile radius has the app but you","This app is pretty interesting. I like how you can connect with different gamers and see what they are interested in. I also like the cards! They are very fun to mess around with. At first being able to swipe limited was bothering me but then I got used to it. The reason why i'm giving 3 stars because I haven\u2019t gotten any matches.. I\u2019m not sure if this is a glitch or maybe it is because they haven\u2019t seen my profile. I\u2019ve been swiping every day for nearly a month now and after getting like 5 matches, I stopped getting match even if I swiped on everyone I see. I hope this make sense. I\u2019m thinking of deleting the app if it is still not working.","I downloaded this app a few month back and just recently started using it more. I downloaded it for the gaming aspect of it not thinking much of it. Once I started actually using the app it was pretty relatable. It\u2019s a lot more focused on my interests than other dating apps. Great job!!","As put the code you guys send me it doesn\u2019t do anything it just stops working","This app has the best look and feel of any dating app. The cards are a pretty good way of expressing yourself and what you like. The sign up process was fun too, loved the feel of a command prompt screen :)","Since I don\u2019t leave my house, I can at least know that the person I meet on here doesn\u2019t leave their house either. So we can just be 2 virgins playing games until 5am everyday. Since I play people in real life already I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not hard to do it on here either. It Would be nice if it would only show you people that play at least 1 of your 9 games you play. And they should really add an option for if you play on PC or Console For obvious reasons. Socially speaking it\u2019s good because everyone on here has the social skills of a rat so conversations can go just about anywhere. Thanks for reading my review and hope u can enjoy the app as much as myself.","Can\u2019t even make an account because it won\u2019t let me upload photos from my phone. Keeps saying \u201ccan\u2019t upload from iCloud server, try again later\u201d","Absolutely loved the easy sign up process and easy to use interface. The concept is great and I love the Card idea. Definitely could use some tweaking like filter by PS or PC players etc or even games. Also, having a spot for a bio would be nice too. I've deleted the app not because of issues but because there is No one interesting in my area and there aren't a lot of users yet. Perhaps as it gains more attention I'll try it again as this is my favorite dating app by far, the advertisements alone had me hooked. You had me at Animal Crossing.","I saw an advertisement for this today and was so excited because it is everything i have been looking for in a dating app! Unfortunately it will to let me list the video games I play. When I go to add a video game, I type in the search box and nothing comes up for me click on. Would love to know how to fix cause as a gamer girl I am trying to find my player 2!!","Why it need a phone number ??? And we need 4 picture of ourself, wat if i dont want to show myself ?? Mean i dont want to meet peuple ? Stupid.","Good app just wish you got more than only 15 swipes before having to go premium for more \ud83d\ude15","It\u2019s Not even that I\u2019ve been looking for a dating app for gamers.

I can\u2019t even use the app. Please help","Really don\u2019t like that there is a limit to how many people swiped a day. It makes the app useless after that and the limit is maybe 20? Not sure but I was swiping for like 5-10 minutes and I was done with my swipes for the day. May delete account because of this \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f","I love this app and the idea behind it to bring fellow video game lovers together and such, but I have had this app for about a month and I have not gotten any matches at all. I tired messing with my settings and I swipe on people everyday, but still nothing so that really disappoints me. I wish there was a way to see if someone has liked your profile so I can get matches. Honestly I have better luck with tinder, but I wanted to try something new but 0 matches after having it for a month and swiping everyday kind of disappointing.","When it asks you for pictures or yourself, it\u2019s taking way too long as if the app is going more than what it\u2019s supposed to with your photos","Not many people near me, but the idea is really solid and so is the interface. Hope more people join!","This app is wack af, only let\u2019s you see like 10 profiles and then u gotta \u201ccome back tomorrow for more\u201d lame af","Only giving me the option to log in via phone number but doesn\u2019t have a UK area code? +44?....","Over all this app truly helps out with people who have gaming lives. You can see what kinda games people like, personality traits, and so much more. Only down side is there is not a lot of people on it. So you will start seeing the same people over and over. So I\u2019m looking forward to once there is more of a base of people. Then this app can be used at its full potential. Thanks for making an awesome app, just hope more people join soon.","So apparently it won\u2019t let me add pictures when I click on the slot and it won\u2019t let me complete my profile without four pictures so fix your broken app","Waste of time and money. Not worth a download.","This app is so unique, i\u2019ve never seen anything like it! I love how it\u2019s mainly based around gaming and personality, unlike the majority of dating apps these days. If there\u2019s one thing I could change, it would be a bigger variety of preference options and a longer \u201cswiping\u201d amount. i personally think it\u2019s unfair that i have to waste my swipes on people who i\u2019m uninterested in. for example, i\u2019m an xbox player and i want to connect with only xbox and psn players but there\u2019s no options for that so i get matched with a pc player. swiping left technically counts as a swipe. i\u2019ve gone 2 days swiping left and have ran out of swipes. if you\u2019re going to limit the amount, i think it should be based on the amount of matches you get and not the amount of people you go through. overall i love this app and i would recommend it to EVERY gamer looking for friends/love!","After a month of use, I\u2019ve just started to click yes on everybody to see if there is at least a response, seems like any accounts on here are either inactive or artificial","The main problem with this app is how few people you\u2019re allowed to see. Without paying for the premium service, you see about 25 profiles per day whether you like them or not, and then you\u2019re locked out of seeing any more new people for 24 hours. If you were to go to Tinder or Bumble or PoF or any other dating app you get at least 50 likes per day and you can view as many people as you\u2019d like.","Kippo has been a good experience for me but just today it kicked me out of my account and then It wanted me to make a new account. And just froze. Ive tried multiple time to reset but it still continuous to be stuck :(","The app works. There\u2019s just no one on here in San Diego. Maybe I\u2019m too picky. The UI is really nice. Hopefully more people start joining because I haven\u2019t seen a recommendation for almost a week now, and I\u2019m not expanding my search either. I\u2019ll stick with tinder for now. Great concept though.","Rly good app, better than Tinder. Just needs more ppl :( Edit- This would be better than Tinder if your sexuality was accounted for. Don\u2019t show me straight men if I\u2019m a man that chooses to see other men.","It asks for a phone verification at the beginning and I put my phone number and it doesn\u2019t send anything.","Really cool design, not a ton of people around me using it. But the app itself is really stylish and well designed. Hopefully gets more popular eventually. Keeping it installed since it\u2019s cool looking and focused on a major part of my life.","It\u2019s a good app but I just bought the exclusive and I just got an infinite by my name that was it???? I thought infinite let\u2019s you swipe how much you want \ud83d\ude22 waste","Of course a dating app with no users and only ~100 reviews is going to add a premium feature. What an obvious cash grab.","I like the concept of the app. But to me it seems like no one is using it. They just made their profiles a long time ago and just stopped using it. You should filter out the least active users. Maybe show when someone was last online.","The 50 swipes a day is really detrimental to the app\u2019s growth. After you swipe 50 cards and you don\u2019t have any matches there is literally nothing to do on the app. My suggestion: As much as I HATE ads (I really really despise them) I feel like it would be a good idea to maybe watch an ad after your 50 swipes to get an additional \u201cx\u201d amount of swipes. That way there is some sort of incentive for the user to stay on the app. I also really hate writing reviews but this app is exactly what I\u2019ve been looking for and would love to see it thrive.","So far this seems like a great concept, implemented pretty well, biggest complaint is that the \u201ccards\u201d can\u2019t be filled all the way out because some fields get covered by the \u201cdone\u201d button (maybe this is unique to older/smaller devices, I\u2019m on an iPhone SE), adding a scroll feature or something so smaller devices can actually complete the cards would be great! I\u2019m also not sure there\u2019s an option for a proper bio? But perhaps one of the cards offers that Otherwise keep it up!","I really liked the idea of the app and I was hoping to try it , till I found out that it only covers 3 regions and I couldn\u2019t log in / sign up with my phone number \u201c I live in Turkey \u201c and it really bumped me out . I was looking forward to new people from the gaming society","I haven\u2019t matched with anyone. I put men and women because I was just looking for friends. But no matches yet? I\u2019m not sure if People are only matching people they wanna smash, or is it ACTUALLY for playing video games. It\u2019s also a bit weird not knowing if the guy u swiped right on is gay or straight.","Distance needs to be an aspect of the matching. So far all I\u2019m getting are people I\u2019d have to travel halfway across the country to see and I don\u2019t have the time, money, or patience to do that.","The games that preview what I play do not show up but it does on other people\u2019s profiles...please fix this!!","After giving this a month of use. It\u2019s pretty stupid. You can\u2019t go to profiles you liked, nor look anything or anyone up. Very beta with so many missing components that should help you, especially to find someone, and extremely limited. Interface is mediocre. I liked its nerdy layout, but when you get locked into you profile, frustration. I would never recommend this site. Finish the site before you give a \u201cOn the spot only\u201d chat system.","I had a problem filling out one of the cards for my profile so I contacted the app support email. I am so glad I did! David helped me out and solved the problem quickly. They really care about the community members that are on this app. I recommend this app to everyone in the gaming community.","I don\u2019t like how the only way to sign up is with a phone number. I already get enough spam phone calls as it is.","As a dating app it isn\u2019t very useful. Under 99 miles were ZERO people. While the profiles are lovely with the ability to make 3 cards and pick 9 games it just didn\u2019t leave enough to further filter people out. It\u2019s a nice concept, but more ways to filter people out need added to be worth using. The button response to go through potential matches were very delayed and sometimes unresponsive. Overall I just don\u2019t see myself using this app.","[EDIT at bottom] I love the style and design of this app for sure. Definitely more unique than what I\u2019ve seen before in similar apps, but I only have one issue with it. It seems that the aspect ratio is off on my iPhone 7s, and it cuts off a little bit of information sometimes. For instance, when doing the personality card, I can\u2019t choose the very bottom option of assertive or turbulent because it is cut off on the bottom. There are a few instances of that happening in the application, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just a small fix for the devs. Love what y\u2019all are doing keep it up! EDIT -Thanks for the response! I did have it set to zoomed instead of standard, and it fixed it! I\u2019ve adjusted my rating, and I appreciate the help!","Tass","I absolutely love how this app looks and works. It\u2019s a great way to meet like-minded people! I just wish you could swipe through more profiles each day. There should be some sort of premium option.","I just downloaded the app, but it was fun creating my profile, and choosing my favorite games, and the cards are really interesting and fun. I would like a choose what you are looking for option, cause I am not looking for a date on this app, just friends who share my interests. I can\u2019t wait for more people to join. My area is a bit small on the app so far. I\u2019m excited to see how it grows!","Easy to use and efficient! You might find very few people in your area, but hey, that\u2019s what the internet is for!","If you don't look like a twitch streamer, no one is going to bother talking to you.","How do I flex my inner nerd online to strangers and connect with them along those interests? Kippo is the answer. Kicking back and watching the community expand and grow. Kippo is next up playa.","So far, I love the app and the concept! It definitely is geared towards gamers, but I do think there should be a \u201clooking for\u201d option as in \u201csomething casual; something serious; friends\u201d etc. I like the card system -it\u2019s creative- but I wish I could use more cards and have more options. Especially if cards are the only way to write text or bios about yourself, I would like the ability to have more cards. Other than that, the only problem is the lack of people but it\u2019s not really a problem the devs can fix unless they advertise around","I initially signed up for Kippo back before it was fully developed, as a place for gamers to meet seemed right up my alley, as nerdy types tend not to do well on the traditional dating apps. While I\u2019ve used Kippo every day since release, I sadly can confirm that it failed to do anything meaningful in all this time. My main gripe is the location bug: it will tell you EVERYONE on the app is within your distance range. I sadly found myself engaging with a wonderful woman, only to discover she lives across the country, and as two people not interested in long distance, we had no further reason to talk. On top of that, the limited talk time is quite an odd feature, and one I can\u2019t actually grasp. Aren\u2019t gamers traditionally the less social types? I myself don\u2019t want to exchange phone numbers with everyone I talk to for 10 days, and it seems like it\u2019s either \u201ccommit or this person disappears\u201d which is NOT the way for someone to feel safe and comfortable in a dating environment. Lastly, my third gripe is the celebrity profiles, just why? I know swiping on AngelsKimi isn\u2019t going to net me a conversation with her, so why is she in my feed? Hell, xChocobars is IN A RELATIONSHIP, seems like she shouldn\u2019t even be on the app, so likely that profile is fake. Why use them? It either excites people not able to reason why they\u2019re not real, or just proves to be a wasted swipe, as you have a limit to profile views in a day. All in all, I cannot recommend Kippo at the current time. I hope the devs create something magical in the future, but as of now, I\u2019ve uninstalled.","5 stars lul","Yooo this is PERFECT. If you don\u2019t want to get out of the house for a first date just play Overwatch bro. Love u! Xoxo -Katabelle","This app looks great. I love the interface and its whole aesthetic. The one big downside is how few people are on it. At least in my area I guess. That\u2019s not really their fault though. It\u2019s gotta be hard to compete with things like tinder and okc. I also would like it if it was required that on your account you had to write at least one small blurb or something about yourself. Even though those are always challenging to write, it is nice to see something in the own words of the person you\u2019re looking at. And to know if they\u2019re looking for friends or dating.","Love that there\u2019s a dating app specifically for gamers! Cute interface, too. I can see what games people are into and it\u2019s a great way to start a conversation and/or even a challenge. If someone can beat me in my game they\u2019ll be my player 2 forever ;)","The UI is incredible, esp for a new app. I think it has lots of room for improvement and can\u2019t wait to see more users on it.","I love the vibe of the app! Finally a step in the right direction for dating apps :)","This app lets you connect with the people in the gaming world that has same interests with you. It\u2019s about time there\u2019s an app for gamers, more gamers should be aware of this platform.","Unfortunately they\u2019re just aren\u2019t too many people using this service. Hopefully that will change. App design and features are stellar.","I have been wanting to find friends to game with and this is exactly that! Also, the culture of the app and the crowd is much better than other apps like this that I\u2019ve used.","In high school I was in a tough situation looking for friends to play games with. I\u2019m glad something like this finally exists!","I\u2019ve dipped my feet into the pool of dating apps before, but have never felt particularly attached to either their interfaces or the people that saturate their user market. I find it very difficult to find people to match with on apps like Tinder, especially since user profiles are left entirely up to the individual to write up for self-promotion, and oftentimes these fall (a lot) short of dazzling. That\u2019s why I really like Kippo. It\u2019s my first time seeing options to fill out fun little quizzes and personality cards to show, rather than blandly tell your interests. There\u2019s a free space card for you to detail a self-introduction written in your own words, of course, but I feel like this feature really takes a burden off the average user\u2019s shoulders in trying to come up with something mildly interesting that others might want to follow up on. I also am a big fan of the neon retro design, which imo, is a super cool aesthetic in line with the gamer theme. But most important/unique of all the features Kippo has to offer is the set timeline for conversations. If you match with someone, you have 24 hours to strike up a conversation with them before they disappear into oblivion. And if one of the matched has plucked up enough courage to initiate the talking, then the two have seven days to converse about anything. And when that time\u2019s up, the conversation is finally sent to the shadow realm for good. At first, I was a little disgruntled by the disappearing act, but I understand now that it\u2019s implemented in order to really motivate people to move outside the app and connect more through a common love of games, movies/tv shows, and other pop culture. It\u2019s a stepping stone, but not the final destination to what is hopefully a super great friendship or \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40 romance!! I\u2019m really impressed with Kippo, which shows since it\u2019s the only \u201cdating\u201d app that\u2019s still kept on my phone LOL.","To start some of the profiles have fake individuals. There are also people on here who don\u2019t even play video games? What? What\u2019s the point? Decent idea but simply this app will turn out like the rest of them, filled with scammers and racist bigotry. Deleted from my hard drive. Good riddance.","Game icons don\u2019t show when I try to add them","Although a fun and quirky app to begin with, a lot of bugs and issues fitting of a new app began to divulge themselves. If you are an avid \u201cswiper\u201d like me, there are barely any people once you get through them. Sure it\u2019s a new app, but it\u2019s hard to use the app when no one is left. Also, you only get 15 swipes per day that don\u2019t refresh unless you use them all. After using them all, you can\u2019t even look at anyone in the list anymore. Along with this, location accuracy has been really buggy and there are no paid options to increase your experience. A great app concept but I think there\u2019s a lot of room for improvement and I am excited to see where it goes.","Great App for gamers looking for friends and maybe more. The only issue right now is the pool size because it is a new app. Excited to see where this app goes in the future. \ud83d\ude00","I like the app so far","Kippo is a really interesting app with a lot of promise and potential. 1. It\u2019s extremely well-polished and you can tell a lot of thought and care has gone into it so far. The creators understand the types of people that would use this app and how existing apps fail them. The onboarding experience is great and there\u2019s a lot of clever ideas that appeal to gamers like the gaming profile cards. I also hugely appreciate tapping instead of swiping since it\u2019s way too easy to accidentally swipe the wrong direction in other apps. 2. Kippo caters to both \u201cdating\u201d and \u201csocial\u201d but it would be good in the future to maybe separate those into two distinct modes so there\u2019s less ambiguity. I can see this app doing really well just as a tool to fill up your various gaming friends lists with people you already know are cool and interesting. 3. The favorite games section is probably one of the most important parts of the profile, so I think it should be a) required to list at least one game and b) make it clearer whether they are just your favorite games or the games you are looking to play with someone else on Kippo. 4. As a brand-new app there\u2019s obviously not a lot of people yet on the app so you might be discouraged by the number of results if you don\u2019t set your slider to max distance (100+). Don\u2019t be discouraged! For a lot of gamers, in a world of duo queues and discord voice chats, distance means nothing. I recommend trying the app and spreading the word because this app WILL grow.","Its an app that brings people from the gaming community together that want to meet new people or find a potential life partner. Kippo has very neat ways of expressing yourself in the form of cards that you can personalize. Would def recommend to anyone that loves games. A few things would be if you live out in the west you\u2019ll have more potential matches near you. So far in NYC area there isn\u2019t much people so you have to set up your distance to pretty much max but that will most likely be remedied as time passes. TLDR; Good for gamers, more users in the west, and not many users in the east close to NY yet.","Kudos for coming up with a unique visual design that manages to work pretty well The cards are a cool idea that could be extended even further (links to Steam profile, LoL, etc., maybe?)","Not a lot of \u201cdating\u201d apps accept gaming. A lot put a tug a on it if anything. This app is early in its public lifecycle, but it\u2019s got a lot of promise and I\u2019m interested to see where it goes.","The only complaint I can have currently is the user pool being small with it just releasing. App is intuitive and easy to use with a clean design. I\u2019m a big fan of how different fandoms are used as categories to find people with similar interests! Very honest and true to their core goals.","As one of the beta member, there wasn\u2019t much to my show my interest on my profile. With the new updates there are plenty of themes you can add on to spice up your page. It is pretty witty and cute to show the other matches your page. A lot of features will probably be added and I am sure this app will be one of the biggest dating game for gamers made by gamers. Give it a try!","Match done. But starting the conversation is where it gets interesting. Kippo has a few great cards that can be customized such as Harry Potter and Pok\u00e9mon themes which have helped me match interests. It is way better than my go to, What\u2019s your name? what\u2019s your sign? Shout out to Big Poppa. However there is an astrology option.
